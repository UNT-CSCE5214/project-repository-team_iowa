       "0  heroes generals had potential but had to mess it up with greed and apathy this game had so much potential to be a good game in fact it was a good game before these updates messed up everything the updates ruined the german faction to the point that any game with the germans is a near certain loss they don t listen to community requests and go on their own to buff things making them op or nerfing the hell out of items whcih devalues the time put in that endless grind to get any item in this game it took around the 6 hour mark to actually get a bare sniper rifle for my infantry which needs an extra 3 hours to get the essential attachments to be any use in matches moving to gameplay it used to be pretty fun with games having an even match that last a considerable amount of time compared to the current match stomps where you only see paratroopers and people sneaking past the lines to steal the obj while the other team goes for their base i have seen countless times where our or the enemy team after a long battle capturing the objective getting their point capture by those paratroopers that drop in every minute right before the point was secured moving past that infantry destroys tanks which makes them obsolete there s barely any reason to play recon since everything is speeden up from the constant stream of crappy updates and they ban many people who hadn t even done anything there s too much to list and it makes this game incredibly boring as well as tilting i can t find any reason why you would play this game in it s current state unless you want to waste time or money which i might add is completely pay to win since the most op weapons are sitting on top of a hefty grind or a pretty penny this game is horribly executing and since the developer don t care of the popular reception will continually to dig a grave for this game   \n",
