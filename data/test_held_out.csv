16058,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewHonestly feels like a Card Game for a PC done right. No limits on what your deck can have (other then color restrictions) pulls it away from the hearthstone feel that it looks like it would have, and some unique interactions have kept me coming back. Didn't realize exactly how much time I had put into the game, which just felt like another reason to rate this game 9/10 (needs more set releases and it goes up to a 10/10) ",1
16059,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access Reviewreally fun card game thats a bit slower than pace than the other popular Free To Play card games in the marketheavily influenced by Magic the Gathering,especailly being able to interact during the opponents turn (which is not surprising considering the people behind the game)love the Arena system that not only lets you keep the cards you drafted but also lets you edit your decks, something games like Hearthstone and Shadowverse is lacking.I think the deck size for constructed is a bit too high so its difficult to have a consistent deck.and also I've been playing this game a lot and still am not able to collect enough cards to have a tier 1/2 constructed deck, but I guess thats where the free to play player has to compromise.Also would love for a better singleplayer campain, but that should be coming soon.8/10, could be a 9/10 with better singleplayer support ",1
16060,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewIn my brief (comparatively) experience with this game I have thuroughly enjoyed it. This has been stated many times but Eternal gives many advantages to F2p's that most CCGs do not. the game positively showers the player with gold constantly, giving out card packs filled with goodies at the slightest reason. You just won your first game of the day? Here's a pack! You just won three games in a row? Here's another pack! you get the point. Now, that being said the game does have flaws. I.E the power system, if you've played magic you understand the inherrent flaws that come with this system. Overall I don't have enough beef with anything here to justify a negative review, the deckbuilding is creative, though the power system is a tad restrictive for my tastes. and there are enough people playing that it usually doesn't take that long to find a match.8/10, you should at least give it a try!",1
16061,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewPlays like Magic and plays like a Magic clone...But with power lvls of a Hearthstone game without the randomness.Great animation and quality.Problem? The old Mana Flood and Mana Screw/Starved.If you like Magic then yeah give it a go but if you are looking for something innovative, this is not it. Before I forget... IT HAS DRAFTING! So yeah, thats pretty god damn awesome. Open some packs, create a deck with those cards and keep the cards you use.Seems like SpellWeaver still has a good implentation of how mana should be handle in a game like Magic.",1
16062,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter wasting a lot of time (and money) in Hearthstone, and being disappointed with games like Faeria and Shadowverse, I wasn't sure what to expect of ""just another card game"". Although Eternal is still in Early Access, this game just blew my mind. It's a lot more complex than Curvestone, it shares a lot of features with MTG, and is developed by one of the most generours and knowledgable companies I've crossed paths with. I hope this game has a lot of sucess, because DWD deserve it.",1
16063,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is an early access game, and my review reflects some of the problems in it. This is not meant to be a bashing of the game, and anything I mention may have been fixed by the developers since this was posted.  This quote from the developers is pertinent: “We're committed to offering players the best card game we possibly can...and that's hard, and messy, and takes time. Onboarding players gradually helps us make sure that the game you're playing is the one we set out to make, and the feedback we get from our growing player community helps us chart a course for launch.”Bottom line: there is the potential for a great game here, but right now (July 2018), there remains a lot of work to be done. I cannot truly recommend this game as I played it, but I am not going to not recommend it. Give it a shot, you might find it works better for you!First big issue: why is my Steam log-in not enough for this game? Why do I need to create a seperate account for it? Other game developers have managed to combine their games with Steam log ins. Please try to do the same!Second issue: in the latter parts of the free/unregistered tutorial, some of the cards did not function as indicated that they would. In particular, there was one which was supposed to let me play it when it was dealt, but I couldn't play it, nor did I get the results from having been dealt and then playing it. I hope this game continues to be developed and grown!",1
16064,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,Early Access ReviewI love this game and thats it. Best card game so far ive played. Best way to earn cards aswell. Damn this is truly Free to Play and even win. Try it its free anyways. Trust me you wont regret it.,1
16065,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is really what I wanted Hearthstone to be.  A game that utilizes the medium of an electronic card game, without making it based on randomness.  Another leg up it has on hearthstone is that there are things you can do on your opponents turn, making it more interactive and less dependent on who draws more creatures.  If you like card games like Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, Duelyst, and Hex you'll love this game.",1
16066,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewVery enjoyable CCG. I would describe it as a hybrid between Hearthstone and Magic. It definitely offers more depth of strategy than HS, coupled with a much friendlier UI than MTGO.  So far I've found that expanding your card collection seems very reasonable for budget players. If you enjoy CCGs, you should give this one a shot.",1
16067,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewIt's been twelve years since I played Magic the Gathering. After playing several other online card games, Hearthstone, Duelyst, Shadowverse, which ostensibly improve upon it, I didn't think I'd be terribly interested in Eternal. I was very wrong. Eternal has been a nostalgic and yet very fresh experience for me, and answers one of my ancient gripes about Magic: having to pay for new cards to enjoy playing the game. The free model for Eternal is one of the most generous out there at this time, and the game itself is fairly clever and fun.",1
16068,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,Early Access ReviewAbsolutely fun game. I was checking for a few games that's free to play and this one I kept playing till 5.30 in the morning for 9 hours straight.You can play it either in Single Player or PvP and SP is a LOT of fun. The graphics are fantastic just like in Hearthstone and they have alot of elements from Magic the Gathering without the complete complexity or adding the extra chores from it.When you versus other people the wait time is only a few seconds so there are a heap of people playing right now.I can't be bothered writing a review so try it out. They are VERY generous at the moment so get in and get all your free stuff and play against the AI or other players and rake it all in before they change it where they're less generous. ,1
16069,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,Early Access ReviewIt's really good. Very reminiscent of Hearthstone. However after the last update it has started consistantly crashing and it's really starting to tick me off. Then again I've got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer that can barely play Plants vs Zombies but I'm curious to see if I'm not the only one suffering crashes. ,1
16070,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewMuch like everyone else here has said, this really is like MTG mixed with a bit of Hearthstone. Basically Hearthstone's visual style and ability to add randomization/decksearch elements and a few other ideas like weapons, mixed with most of the best MTG mechanics. The *tutorial* impressed me enough for me to want to drop money on it, which says a lot, I think, especially since I've played dozens of these games.",1
16071,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is awesome, it is no doubt the best digital card game out there. It is like a magic the gathering mod with a lot of rewards, and totally free to play.I recommend this to every played that is frustrated because of the bad state hearthstone is.This CCG borrows the mechanics from magic the gathering and so other cool mechanics like echo, infiltrate or warcry.I cant recommend this game more, give it a try.",1
16072,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewComing from Hearthstone and Magic Duels, this game is combination of the two but better than both. Heavily addicted to this right now. Graphical style of Hearthstone and complexity of Magic the Gathering all in one. Cards are well designed and very interesting. Game is quite generous for cards and packs. There are many game modes, including a true draft format. My only complaint is that game has the ancient stupid land (sigil in this) based mana system of Mtg, so be prepared to be mana screwed or flooded occasionally. Hearthstone's simple but effective mana system is simply better.",1
16073,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewGreat card game thats easy to get into and deep enough to keep your interest. Additionally, its a very forgiving F2P system that you really can grind out pretty easily without spending a dime.",1
16074,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal manages to be a great compromise between the accessibility and digital interface of Hearthstone and the complexity and deckbuilding of Magic. While the game doesn't  manage to avoid the grinding issues Hearthstone has (primarily due to expensive, deck defining Legendaries), it's pretty generous with giving out free stuff in the form of gold and packs. The digital nature of the game is exploited wonderfully in mechanics that could never work in a physical card game like Magic, and ways that would probably be too complex for Hearthstone (which tended to use its digital nature mainly to produce RNG effects).Overall, Eternal is a great card game with a lot of competitive promise, though currently held back a little by the limited pool of cards available. Oh and if my 20+ attack creature could stop taking half a year to finish it's attack animation, that'd be great too.",1
16075,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe most strategic online TCG experience available, with depth comparable to Magic: The Gathering.F2P progression is much more reasonable than competitiors like Hearthstone.Slick, stable graphics + gameplay.An exciting and durable card game which will only get better.",1
16076,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewHas the best mechanics from all the card games that I've played , a nice mix between hearthstone , MTG and Yu-Gi-Oh .You will love this game if you love a good challenge with a bit of luck and cant get enough from the mind games",1
16077,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal is great! Started playing in closed Beta and have been hooked ever since. The easiest way to describe it would be like ""fixed Magic"", as it has many of the same rules. In addition, there are tons of sweet new mechanics, fun decks to play, and a well-balanced Ranked and Draft environment. Well over 100 hours of gameplay already, and I expect to play hundreds more! If you like card games you need to give Eternal a try :D",1
16078,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewMagic: The Gathering (MTG), with a few digital tricks.Easy to earn rewards and packs, and includes a great vs. AI mode for thsoe that don't always want to play players.",1
16079,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI think this game is currently the closest thing to a ""Magic the Gathering"" adaption on the digital market. It combines the simplicity of Hearthstone with the depth of Magic.It contains a lot of playmodes: Several designed PvE encounters, two procedural PvE modes (one mimicing draft), casual and ranked PvP and a very well designed Draft PvP mode.Additionally, the reward system is very generous and allows starters to quickly get into the game.All in all: This game scratches my MtG itch when needed and is not as expensive or shallow as HS.",1
16080,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,Early Access ReviewI don't know how they did it but they made this game even more fun than magic!  It's hard to belive it's in early access when it's this good! I reccomend this to anyone who greatly enjoy card games like magic or just like card games in general. Easy and fun to master the wide variaty of techniques the game has in store. The future of this game looks great!,1
16081,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewSo far I've played through the tutorial missions to unlock each deck. I can already see I'm going to be dumping loads of hours into the game. As a big card game player already (MTG, Hearthstone, Duelyst, and Shadowverse) I can say that the mechanics in this game, while borrowed, really flourish with mechanics that make sense. The only gripe I have is some effects on cards aren't explained in detail when you scroll over it. It seems to only give a basic definition of what keywords are. Some cards have non keyworded words on them that you would need to go look up to know.",1
16082,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI stopped playing M:TG around 14 years ago, I play Hearthsone, Elder Srolls Legends and Duelyst, also tried HEX, but this seems to be getting my favourite.  The gameplay is very good, interface looks nice and the rewards are generous (PVP and PVE). Try it out if you like card games you won`t be disappointed. If you don`t like card games you will start to love them after playing Eternal.",1
16083,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewYet another good mtg clone. Yet without trading, it is worthless. If you play 4 free, its a fine game. When you need to get serious, then it definitely will cost you. I remember buying my couch by selling my extra mtg cards, this is not what you invest and have some return of investment.",1
16084,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewUpdate after 1.26 patch.So, I no longer play this game and can't recommend it, because gold gains have been nerfed intensely twice in a row by the developer, and this game is becoming more and more obnoxiously ""pay or don't play"" at least for draft mode.=========================================================================This game is a good take on the Digital Card Game genre, it combines the mechanics depth of Magic the Gathering with simplicity and beauty of Hearthstone. The f2p model here isn't obnoxious, you can totally play this as a free game, but ofc if you want a full collection at all times you can hurry it up with some packs. There are several gamemodes including some singleplayer ones (vs AI) for the times you are just not feeling the urge to play vs players. This game utilizes the fact that it is a digital game well, doing a lot of interesting stuff with it's mechanics, also in contrast to Hearthstone it doesn't rely TOO much on RNG (except for the power part, but that's something every deck has to deal with and is kind of a feature). Anyway, if you are interested in Digital CCG - this is the one to try. It's free, what could go wrong?This game also has a working iOS client (for now it's Canada/Australia only, but that's not very hard to get around ;D)While this game is currently in beta/early access it has been feeling as a feature complete and full game for quite some time now, so don't let that scare you away.",0
16085,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal combines the best parts of Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering to create a CCG experience that is similar to both but unlike either. MTG players will recognize mechanics similar to lands, dual lands, instants, five different mana colors, and battle mechanics like trample, deathtouch, lifesteal, first strike, and flying. Because this game is digital, it can do things that you could never do with physical MTG cards, like the Warcry mechanic that add +1/+1 to the top unit of your deck when you attack. There are much fewer RNG elements here than Hearthstone, and some nice of themes to build your deck around like an army of valkyries, a gang of gunslingers, a pack of dniosaurs, or suicidal grenadins.Progression feels so much more rewarding than in Hearthstone! In addition to daily quests, you also get a free card pack for your first win of the day, and these packs have TWELVE cards instead of five AND include enough crafting materials to make a common or uncommon card of your choice. Yes, you get crafting materials IN the card packs! You also get gold for every win (not every 3 wins) which can be spent on card packs. There is also a leveling system in place for each of the 5 factions (red, blue, green, black, and white). When you level up in a faction, you get additional rewards like gold or a free pack, and XP is earned based on the decks you play. So focus on one or two colors to level those up faster, or run a rainbow deck (and there are some GREAT rainbow decks) to level up all five evenly.You have the typical PvP modes like casual, ranked, and a draft pick that is extraodinary! After you pay the entry fee, you open a bunch of randomized card packs and then pick and pass to create a pool, and from that pool you create a deck. It's almost exactly like something you'd see at a MTG event. There are also PvE modes here. The Gauntlet has you fight AI opponents using any custom decks you've created, and Forge is like Hearthstone's draft pick mode. There are a few campaigns that have a steep entry fee but give you guaranteed rewards.All in all, I really enjoy Eternal far more than Hearthstone or Magic. And oh yeah, there is a mobile app as well, so I can play on the bus to work. I've played a lot of digital card games (Hearthstone, Gwent, Faeria, Duelyst, Legends) and Eternal ranks #1 in my book.",1
16086,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you like Magic or other card games with some strategy and depth to them, I'd highly recommend checking this game out. This is a genuinely good F2P card game that's worth your attention (or at least trying!), and I've been hooked since I've found it. It's a lot more fair on pricing and handing out cards than similar games (looking at you, Hearthstone), and there's some genuinely cool mechanics that make use of the fact that this is a PC game without just making them all ""lol random effects"" (such as Warcry).There's quite a bit of content here, including several campaigns and roughly 100 puzzles to help you learn and mess with the mechanics in the game. Plus you can do drafts, free gauntlets against the computer with interesting ""boss"" mechanics, and others.It might take you a bit of time to make the exact deck you want, but it's totally viable without spending money; and I think this is a quality enough game to spend a little on anyway as a ""thank-you"" to the devs for their hard work. Hope you enjoy!",1
16087,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIt's the freest to play CCG on the market, taking the MTG rules set and streamlining it but without losing the ability to cast Instants or declare blockers. Also, the best Draft mode is here. You keep what you draft.",1
16088,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is like magic the gathering if you could just get all the cards by grinding. therefore its 100000000x (one hundred billion times) better than magic. this is THE way to waste every single one of your waking hours, and if you need to quit your job in order to play more, you won't even fall behind in the meta for the inability to buy more cards. you just keep grinding.good game, but i wish ranked mode gave better payouts than the ai mode.",1
16089,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI love Eternal.I played MTG since I was little (I am 30 now), played HS, played Gwent, played Duelyst.For a couple of months now, Eternal's been my go-to CCG. I really, really like this game.Yes, there's the mana flood/screw issues some people write in their reviews. Truth is, it does not appear nearly as often as those people make it seem like. Some games are frustrating. Some games you are cursing because you cannot believe the luck the opponent had, or the bad luck you had, not drawing one of your 123 possible answers to win it. It's part of the game. It makes you appreciate those hard fought, fair victories all that much.Eternal is the best possible in-between in complexity from MTG to HS. And there're no fury-inducing RNG cards (like the attrocities you'd find in Duelyst or HS). The complexity of the game is in its deckbuilding, and I just love that.F2P wise, it's super generous. A couple of free packs a day are easily obtainable (one with the first win each day), and whenever you draft, you keep all you drafted (although draft prices are a little bit higher than in other tcgs for this reason).Bottom line is, yes, I do recommend this game. Very, very much.Set 3 is about to be released, so this is as good a time as ever to come play Eternal.  Come, play Eternal.",1
16090,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is super fun, easy to learn, and easy to get into. There are in-game purchases, but the rate you earn cards just by playing is great. You can build a good competitive deck after playing through the tutorial quests and doing some drafts. If you enjoy Magic, Hearthstone, or any card game, be sure to give this one a shot. It's free, what do you have to lose?",1
16091,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI think this game is half way from Magic: The Gathering and half way from Heartstone. This game includes all of the best thing I like in those:- beautiful contents- big game field- thousands of possible deck compination- good AI for local game- challanging AI- lots of game modes- good community- if i loose i can lots of tricks from the opponent- loot more then in heartstone- easy way to get what you want- good daily dropFor me, this is the best online card game ever!",1
16092,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe best card game I have ever played.I recommend for anyone that are into card games.It's free...Pros:-Very free to play friendly-Ability to create your own decks with relative easeCons:-Most people do not create their own decks-Basically the only decks you see are rakano plate and armory, and most decks cannot even compete with them-Occasionally one can be triggered because of luck",1
16093,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you like Hearthstone or MTG this game is 100% worth a try.  It has fun mechanics, frequent updates and even free-to-play players can build a top tier deck in short order.  Mobile client is good, too.",1
16094,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal combines MTG mechanics with a great online experience.MTG flaws (like powerflooding) have been ironed out (with scout/nightfall/merchant/redrawmechanic), althought some of the measures have problems themselves. But Eternal doesn't stop there and addes new mechanics that either replace ridiculous MTG mechanics: Hexproof was replaces by Aegis, an effect that only protects from one spell or effect; First-/Doublestike have been changed to Quickstrike, which only prevents damage while your Unit is attacking, not while blocking. Other mechanics have been added that are simply not possible in a TCG, for example warcry and revenge, and since Decks can be build out of every Combination of Factions this adds up to a multifaceted and adaptable game like few other with further potential and developers willing to use it.",1
16095,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI put more hours into this than I expected, really. I was originally looking for something to scratch my MTG itch while waiting to see if I got a Beta key for Arena, but, after playing this, I really couldn't care less to get one. My only real gripe with the game is that some of the art is rather... displeasing to my tastes, while also addressing that this is an early access card game. There's going to be balancing issues. There's going to be shifts. That's expected; however, what is here is a joy to play. Got it both on PC and Tablet and I can say that it has become one of my favorite digital card games in almost no time. As for the Redshell debacle, I think I came into this after that, so I cannot say anything on the matter.I will update this review as time goes by, but, so far, I recommend it. (Though I am just a filthy casual: Gauntlet, Forge, Casual, and Draft for life).Edit 1: After three weeks, I managed to unlock the first campaign, Jekk's Bounty, with only gold you earn in-game. 20,000. If I had to estimate the amount of time I truly played, between PC and Tablet, I would say about 30 hours. That's about... 666 gold an hour... I did not expect that number, but... yeah! The other campaigns currently out are 25,000 apiece, so it's roughly 35-to-40 hours to unlock campaigns --or $30, if you prefer to pay. In all truth, that's still good value. I have about 43% of the original card stock unlocked through simply chests, and about 10% of the special packs each, with the exception being Fall of Argenport at 28%.Edit 2: I finally received a closed beta code for MTGA... I knew I made the right call. This game feels FAR BETTER to play. Let's break down my first, oh, thirty games out of MTGA's tutorial. First game, used the green deck, I swore my opponent was a bot with how bad they played. Second game, same issue... Third game, WHIPLASH. I was obviously NOT on the same level with the guy, and I got creamed. Fourth-tenth game, lost due to manaflood. 11 card draws in a row, all lands. Twelth game, guy quit after calling seven mulligans, having nothing in his hand. Thirteenth-through-seventeenth, actually good games. Fair. Balanced. I lost fifteen and sixteen, but they were fun. Eigtheen-through-twenty-five were jobs. Opposite problem this time; I only had TWO LANDS the entire time. Twenty-six through twenty-eight swapped to the black deck, got nothing but high-priced cards, and twenty-nine and thirty I played blue and once more faced people WAY out of my skill level.Let's break all that down, shall we? 1) Matchmaking is hilariously bad. Sure, it's quick. None of them went above 15 seconds, but they were laughably one-sided for most of them. 2) deck randomization/""shuffling"" is not working as intended, unless it is to inspire hatred. 3) IT WAS BORING. The UI layout is pretty, but when you have to look at it for easily fifteen minutes a match, waiting as someone agonizingly waits out timers to play the most simple of spells, it grows old fast.Overall, I much prefer Eternal over MTGA. Just... Eternal may have its issues, but, after dealing with that, I am coming back with a smile on my face. I mean, I never left, but... I don't know where I was going with that. And to clarify: I don't hate MTGA. It's fine for what it is, and it has the capacity to get better.Edit 3: Twitch Prime! Lots of goodies... this is going to be a critiquing post.One, I have to agree, standard decks are a touch too big. I believe 75 is just a tad too large. On top of that, it demanding EXACTLY 1/3 of it being land is a touch annoying. Note that I am not saying you should run below it, but there are some strategies where having, say, two or four less lands does work into its favor. Also note you can have more than a 1/3 lands, as well.Two, Time-Justice combo is overpowered. Period. Just like Green in MTG, it runs rampant. The fact certain combos haven't been nerfed while Tribal's Levitate was speaks volumes...Three, the mobile app has become a nightmare to play... There's not much else I can say about that. It feels like it takes forever updating or something in the code has been changed enough for it to run like crap on my tablet AND phone. Computer one still runs perfectly fine.Really, these are minor gripes. I'm closing on the 45-hour mark on PC, and, got to say, still want to keep playing. That's an achievement in of itself.Edit 4: DWD making me working overtime. :) They did nerf the combo.Edit 5: To sum up all the negative reviews in one, tidy package-""RNG IS BAD SO IT IS BAD."" Translation: I don't know how to build a deck or rework it so I can do better and instantly blame everyone but myself.""TUTORIAL TOO LONG."" They already said they are working on it.""MANA SYSTEM IS BAD AND WOULDN'T BE BECAUSE [insert popular game here]!"" The irony in these people is palpable, esp. those saying the creator would have done something different. Probably, but hindsight is 20/20. Get. Over. it.""HEARTHSTONE RIP-OFF."" In terms of... Oh. Right. They just say it. If its for the UI... WOW. a GOOD UI THAT OTHERS TRY TO REPLICATE WHILE ADDING THEIR OWN TAKE ON IT? SAY IT AIN'T SO... Artstyle? Different enough. Gameplay? more like Magic-Lite.""CERTAIN CARDS ARE OP AND IMBALANCED."" Welcome to card games. Also, those that usually say this also add the first two, which, again, the irony because they blame everything but themselves for failing.This should wrap up what most people say to get approved. If you are these kinds of people, I feel so sorry for you... Oh, and Red Shell, but, as the initial review has stated, cannot speak on that.Edit 6: Since this has become a thoughtpiece on my opinion of MTG Arena as well as Eternal, I guess I'll post what I think of it after it came to open b-Don't. Even. Bother.They learned NOTHING in the transition. Matchmaking is still crap. Deck shuffling algorithm is still crap, and this is me making my mono-green ramp carnage tyrant-Vine Mare-Blanchwood combo again with 97% winrate. Only Boros at the moment comes close, and they are all the same cookie-cutter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. On top of that, they cut rewards for winning games, making grinding an obscene chore while, also, allowing paid players to keep their currency --which is fine IF THE MATCHMAKING WAS GOOD.In every aspect, Eternal has shown to be the more rewarding game. The more fun game. Sure, it can have its stagnant meta decks, but more oft than not I ran into people doing SOMETHING different. SOMETHING that went against the mundanity of the meta.Edit 7: WotC ""listened"" to the community for MTG:A... It feels like they planned it the entire time and were using it for good press. Until they actually listen and follow up on what is being said, since closed mind, I'm not changing my stance on it.That being said, [in Eternal] I joined the new league... I had terrible luck with the packs, but I still find it fun to watch. Another point to this game: it pushed me to try the ""non-casual"" scene, and I enjoyed it. Plus, that card back is sexy.",1
16096,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewWithout a doubt the most Free2Play CCG I've ever played and I'd like to think I've tried them all. With Set 3 on the horizon, now is a good time to get into this. Especially recommend if you need a break from HS or MTG.",1
16097,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThe exact sort of game I was hoping Hearthstone would be!  As my play time indicates I'm somewhat into this game (and it doesn't even include mobile time)!While it doesn't have as much depth/interaction as Magic (as if any game even comes close) the mechanics it chose to remove ended up being a very smart move for a digital game.  Removing the excessive places to cast spells makes this game play so smoothly.And the mechanics of this game FINALLY embrace the digital platform in ways other games failed.  Graveyard mechanics, cards that remember their buffs even when put back in the deck, not having to reveal your entire hand when your opponent is looking for only units to discard.  With a VERY generous reward system in place, this game is very worth trying out (you just gotta survive the overly-long tutorial).",1
16098,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewOut of all the card games I've played this has to be the best one yet. Direwolf has continued improvements to the game through 4 sets of cards, and the expansions are fun and rewarding! The only bad part about this game I see is the mulligan system for opening hands. 9/10 Would get rekt in competitive again",1
16099,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI recommend this game only if you want a more accessible and enjoyable version of MTG.  After collecting most of the cards the game has to offer and after playing Gwent, I have come to realize that both Eternal and MTG are too often decided by luck, and very little by strategy.  You start with 7 cards: Lets say you get lucky and start with this hand:-3 are mana-1 card costs 1 -2 cards costs 2 -1 card costs 3-And you draw all the right cards.In most cases you have just 1 viable play to make.   Honestly, I feel that a larger starting hand is required to call it a deep strategy game.   After the fun of collecting most of the cards was over, I got bored quickly after logging in each day.  Even after the new set, this boredom did not seem to go away.",1
16100,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"I started playing eternal almost three years ago, and have played consistently since then.  I haven't played modo since I picked it up, and I tried arena but find it lacking in critical ways.  I've tried out hearthstone, gwent, and artifact, but none of them have really taken my interest.  I love that I can pick up and play 1-5 games a day, or if I want to play some events I can play for hours.  The game economy is friendly and sensible, decks are interesting.  I can play draft, sealed, or constructed.  The AI mode is fun for days when I just want to mess around with basically zero thinking, or if I'm on a bad connection or know I'll be interrupted.  The dev team is responsive to community requests, and keeps a close eye on comments (reddit/discord/twitch), in-game feedback, and the constant pile of stats they gather on all aspects of the game.  I haven't felt the game get stale, which is amazing for the length of time I've been playing.  It's easy to play for free, I recommend picking it up to try it out for a bit.  Check in on reddit and discord to get some pointers, the community focus is one of the best parts of the game.  There's also some very approachable twitch streamers, you can get a good feel for things by watching any of the more popular ones for a few minutes.  Twitch chat is amazingly non-toxic, you can ask questions and get useful answers to just about anything.",1
16101,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"My original review from jan'17, probably launch of the EA was negative. I gave it another try at steam release, and it is a very pleasant surprize. The devs were not sitting on their hands, but created way more mechanics, so the old boredome is left in the past. Also there are different play modes. And a ton of puzzles. The latter alone would be enough for a thumbs up.I have no intention to use the money shop,and not really interested in the competitive part where I doubt p2w is avoidable in this model. At start the game seems to drop plenty of cards at you, so I guess it will take some time till I get bored with the guantlet and forge. Also have to mention that the gfx is top notch and the interface as good as you can ask for. I hope it won't get ruined by greed, like plenty other games with similar business model.",1
16102,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewEdit2: I am again updating this review, since i think the game has changed somewhat since my last one:After a season of imbalance and a meta which became so stale it was virtually reeking, a new expansion brought a fresh breeze into the entire game again, shaking up some things, while strengthening its core of ""infinite possibilities of a deep strategy card game"" as they write it themselves. With the introduction of the ""Fall of Argenport"" (i think it actually has a decent lore, though this is not the main point), the developers managed to rebalance a lot of the game, offering new possibilities for deckbuilding and making a wider, more interesting veriety of decks viable, which gives me the feeling, that it now reached its best state yet. This is the main reason i feel very positive about recommending it (again).However, i am aware, that the ongoing expansions come at the increasing cost of accessibility for new players, because it needs more and more investment either in time or money to get the cards you want, as well as becoming more difficult/ needing more experience to understand which cards may benefit your decks more - though this is basically true for any CCG. So i am wondering, how this will be addressed in the future and where the game as a whole might still go from here.Edit1: I was dissapointed for a while that, while a couple of updates brought changes, they didn't seem to address some of the major flaws of the game. This changed with the recent update (1.18.2), as they implemented a counter measure to the infamous ""mana-screw/ mana-flood"" problem and they even expressed some thoughts on their approach. So, while i still think that more can be done, the devs have proven that they listen and try to respond, which i think is a good reason for further recommendation.It's the younger, sexier cousin of MagicIn short, Eternal is a must try for every digital CCG enthusiast and i think there's no reason for others not to try it as well. I bet, or at least hope a lot of people will get hooked by it.The strengths of Eternal probably aren't the graphics or sound, they're decent enough, it looks nice and the sound probably won't hurt your ears, though i've muted it for the sake of my own music after little time and it could look a little better or worse, i think it wouldn't make much of a difference, because those aren't the core of Eternal's experience. I'd say, that's where the mechanics and accessibility of the game are.The comparison of Eternal to Magic: The Gathering definitely isn't farfetched. I've very actively played Magic for a couple of years some time ago and when i first played Eternal i immediately felt at home - which is not at all surprising, since the devs are Magic-players as well. Many mechanics are similar: The turn structure is almost the same, mana is called power, there's flying, trample is called overwhelm, haste is charge and there are many more in slight variations. So, if you really don't like Magic, you might not like Eternal, but i'd say you should still try, considering Eternal kind of looks and feels like the younger, sexier cousin of Magic, who offers some moves which feel familiar, but a bit different at the same time and who promises improvement during joyful consenting playtime, where Magic might feel like it's trying too hard to impress, just to grab your money.The whole structure of the game often makes it feel a little slower than other recent CCGs and the resource mechanic can lead to frustrating bottlenecks in play if you heavily draw against the odds, but on the other hand i'd say there are a lot more possibilities to combo and build various decks with interesting strategies. I think it is rather well balanced, though there are certain cards which result in hefty power spikes and some i'd consider useless (as is often the case in most CCGs). But there is no card, deck, or strategy which can't be beaten by others, the game usually isn't decided in just a couple of turns and every turnaround can feel satisfying.And, as rarely as it happens, i'd actually consider this game free to play, as you not only can get everything the game has to offer without paying anything, the rate at which you gain cards is actually pretty good, i'd say generous, which makes it possible to get strong/ tier 1 decks relatively fast and to experiment often.And, well, if the current mass of positive reviews haven't convinced you to try and you haven't turned your back already because you hate CCGs in general, i honestly don't know what will change your mind.",1
16103,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewFor new players and skepticals, here are several things that are helpful to know. This game is a true hidden gem, and leagues better than what a first look would indicate.1) For all that matters Eternal is functionally out of beta and has been for a year. The devs constantly roll out new features that the community didn't even know they wanted (like puzzles and casual mode - which, fair warning, is unranked and new players will do well to play in ranked instead of casual). It is fully worthy of being a released game, so don't let the tag stop you.2) The tutorial is, for many players, long and arduous. Don't let that turn you away from a great, great CCG both gameplay and economy-wise. Push through it, and you'll be rewarded. You only need to complete the first campaign (Fire), then complete a run of Gaunelet (you can concede the first game if you like), after which everything will be unlocked for you.3) Many of the reviewers on here complaining about the power system are overexaggerating and/or don't use the proper tools the game gives (and has been supplying increasingly with the new sets) to migitate it. Moreover, there are legitimate arguments for why this system makes for a better and more dynamic game. I have 600 hours on this and power screw has never been enough of an issue to bother me.4) Yes, there are pushed cards in the game. No, this does not mean the balance is bad or that new players are gatekeeped from good decks. There are several ranked viable decks that contain little or even no legendaries, not to mention many budget decks that will service you fine in lower ranks. The pushed cards help serve a purpose in supporting factions and metagames, and enable new archetypes instead of being overpowered (yes, really.)With these things in mind, I hope you give Eternal a try and enjoy it as much as I do.P.S.For more detailed information on the F2P quality of this game, and the necessity of its power system, read the below articles.

16104,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewTL;DR--------------------Pros:  fun gameplay that's not too simple and not too complex  incredibly generous F2P model Cons:  lengthy and lackluster tutorial/campaign that you have to play through to get to other play modes  interesting lore, but it doesn't really come through from playing the gameIn depth review:--------------------So I played Hearthstone for about 2 years with the goal of spending no money on it. After that time (around Journey to Un'Goro) I felt like Hearthstone was at the point where I could no longer build any decks that were fun to play without either investing both a ton of money and a ton of time. I had been playing Eternal on and off since a little over halfway through the closed beta, but at that point I switched over to it as my dcg of choice.I really like this game for 2 main reasons:1) It's simpler than mtg, but more complex than Hearthstone.    I really like mtg, but I don't really like having to physically go to a place and interact with people in order to play it (especially if they're non-casual mtg players). I don't much like the large amount of rng in Hearthstone. Eternal is the perfect blend of being simple enough to be represented as a dcg, but complex enough that it is as enjoyable as mtg. It feels like it has enough rng to make things varied, but not so much that it starts to make your decisions feel less meaningful.2) I feel like I can build decks that are fun to play without having to spend any money.    I generally play this game for about 1hr a day on the train on the way to and from work (so in reality my hours played is probably a decent amount higher than Steam reports). I felt like the decks I was able to make at lower tiers were still fun to play, and after several months of focused playing I was able to make some of the budget upper tier decks. At this point I can pretty easily get to the highest rank each month, and can make about half of the tier 1 decks. I've spent no money to get cards since I started playing this game. I have spent some money for cosmetic effects in game, since I want to support the developers, which is not something I felt inspired to do with Hearthstone.Some things I don't like about this game:* As many have probably said, the tutorial/campaign is sort of boring. That alone wouldn't be so bad, but you have to play through it completely before you can do anything else. I wish that you only had to play through a few tutorial games and then you gained access to the other modes of play, as then you'd be able to bounce back and forth between modes and it would greatly help avoid things getting boring, I think.* There's some interesting lore to this game underneath the surface, but you have to sort of dig for it. It doesn't come across very strongly from just playing the game.* I'm not sure why it still ""early-access"" on Steam? The game now has 3 full sets and 2 expansions (think Hearthstone adventures), and it's definitely not a game that would be considered in beta. I can't really think of any additional features or polish that this game would require in order that would warrant it being considered ""fully released"".",1
16105,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI really enjoy the Magic-meets-Hearthstone gameplay and epic-action polish of eternal. It's very generous with free-to-play rewards, so you get a fun sense of progression, and there are regular promos and events. My absoolute favorite element of the game -- the one that keeps me playing it even when Hearthstone is so much more polished -- is the wonderful Limited gameplay modes. There's ""Forge,"" sort of a version of Hearthstone's Arena that's playable against increasingly strong AI opponents, and there's draft -- even better, reasonably effective asynchronous draft, so you don't have to devote a huge block of time to playing or wait for the draft queue to launch, and it's okay if you get interrupted/etc. very much worth checking out if you like collectible card games at all.",1
16106,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access ReviewWithout paying anything I had a top-tier control deck after a few weeks and 30 hours of playtime.Meanwhile in HS you're stuck playing budget aggro for ~3 months unless you buy packs (or can go infinite in arena and have tons of time).,1
16107,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewRecent changes sure makes you question the future of F2P. but overall this is still the best digital card game out there. It's fun, and I feel like I can trust the developers and where they are taking the game.",1
16108,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewBy Far, The Most Generous F2P Digital CCG I've PlayedSo, I've played Magic: the Gathering for 15 years or so. And the recent wave of digital CCGs have been nice, but overall lacking. They're super simplified to the point where a lot of the strategy and meaningful interaction seems to disappear. Additionally, they can be stingy with giving you access to the very cards you need to play the game.None of those apply to Eternal, from my time playing it.I've played for a few months, and have access to every common and uncommon in the two sets released as of the time of this writing, as well as most of the rares. Legendaries are still a crapshoot, but I have plenty of shiftstone to craft whatever Legendaries I need. I mean, packs just give you 100 shiftstone each, and you get a free pack for your first win of the day. The rewards are so plentiful, and you'll sometimes have a reward chest just randomly upgrade. (Those rare times you see a lowly copper chest upgrade all the way to platinum are just glorious.)Eternal feels like what Magic would look like if it was made now. All the strategy is there, and so much of my Magic knowledge easily ports over. Some things are streamlined, but not in a way that removes strategic depth. (No clunky phases, for example. Everything smoothly moves from start to combat to end and everything in between.) And all the interaction on your opponent's turn that other games shy away from? Not this game. (Similarly, it's not afraid to give you tools against cards sitting in your opponent's hand.) And there's plenty of mechanics that take advantage of the game being digital without overly relying on randomness.This is one of the rare F2P games where I'm happy to spend money to help the devs. And quite frankly, the devs are names I trust coming from my Magic background. (Seriously, most of these guys are big name Magic pros.) And with a mobile version that let's me carry my entire collection over, I can show it off to my friends wherever I am. I don't know why it's still carrying the Early Access tag, but I do hope for great things from this game's future.",1

16114,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal Card Game is the card game for people who dislike magic and hearthstone. It does not allow the complex interactions, counterspells, and control features of magic that appeal to many magic players, and also does not bring the random rng elements of hearthstone that appeal to hearthstone players. Its a game for people who want to play creatures and smash face without worrying too much about being punished for doing so. There are control elements, but with each passing set the creature decks have more and more tools to combat the control style decks. What has resulted from these design decisions is a game about creature-based combos and creatures decks. If you desire a more magic like experience with control and interaction, this may not be for you. ",1

Even the fastest aggro decks require a little more decision making than in Hearthstone because of this. - A very generous economy. I have invested some money because I want to support the developer, but by most any metric Eternal is the most free to play card game out there. - Free PvE with decent rewards - Interesting mechanics and not too much randomness, many viable decksAll together, the strategy is deep and the games are a blast.

With a fairly generous grind for cards, Eternal is easily the best online tcg out there.",1
16119,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewA very solid game that borrows heavily from Magic The Gathering, with the user friendly UI Hearthstone spearheaded.The game is easy to pick up if you've come from other cardgames, and the tutorial and puzzles are there to teach and reward those who have never played cardgames in a fun and effective way.Depth is great as well, decisionmaking and order of execution end up mattering a lot more than early tempo, so the better player does end up coming out on top a lot more than in most other online CCGs.A big barrier to entry in a cardgame is cost, and boy, does this game nail that.By the time I was done beating most of the single player content I'd already cobbled up 2 of the tier 1 decks at the time, because EVERYTHING you do is rewarded in gold or packs, no daily limits on earnings, no copouts when fighting the AI in Gauntlet (free Arena runs VS. AI), not to mention you get to keep all of the cards you pick in your Drafts and Arenas. It will always reward the time you spend on it, no matter what, and it makes for a very welcoming new player experience.A great place of refuge for those tired of the increasingly frustrating randomness of Hearthstone or those who have graduated from it and crave something more complex.",1

It also features a draft mode where you open a pack, pick a card, then pass the pack to the next player and pick a card from another--all cards you pick you keep permenantly making it yet another  way players can grow a collection for free.Eternal has a great, active reddit community (https://www.reddit.com/r/EternalCardGame) to assist new players getting ramped up to speed.",1

I felt like some wins weren't earned, and it was just a stall point to the next opponent, one deck didn't play a single monster, just stuck with spells to give them more power until I won.

16132,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewGame runs very well on my phone and tablet which I have played the majority of hours on.  Even my 4-inch phone is easily playable due to clever interface design.  The game is also synchronized between your devices and steam account.Presentation, artwork, and progression/card collection are derivative of Hearthstone. What this means (if you never heard of Hearthstone) is that the ""cards"" animate themselves on the game board so it's easy to tell what their doing (attacking creatures smack the enemies, flying creatures hovering, spells shooting across the battlefield).  Not much is left to imagination (as would be the case in physical card games) which helps new players keep track of what's going on.  Card artwork skews toward ""cartoony"" but not in a childish way.  Admittedly I'm not a fan but that's personal taste.Players earn cards through gameplay or opening packs but cannot trade with other players.  At the time of this review, the first PvP win of the day rewards a pack of cards.  This is an extremely generous way for players to complete their collection of common and uncommon cards with minimal grind.  Rares and legendaries will still require grinding or $$.The gameplay itself is derivative of MTG.  So expect 5-color, playing resources, defender choosing who blocks, and instant spells on opponent's turn.  There are many keywords that take advantage of the digital space like warcry and echo.  Eternal features PvE modes but they feel more like a temporary thing to train up until you're ready to PvP.I'm giving this game a thumbs up because:- easy pick up and play- well-polished presentation- strong support for mobile devices- room for complexity and growthNow for the issues...-Many players complain about the MTG style resource system that causes some games to be unplayble due to not drawing enough or too many resources.  The mulligan system and certain cards try to mitigate this, but it is still there.  Expect power screw, but no worse than MTG.-75 card minimum deck reduces consistency.  This can cause deck building to lean toward high quality cards that are strong regardless of the deck instead of weaker cards that better synergize with the deck.-There is also a massive power disparity between legendary cards and uncommon/commons.^ These two points may be how Direwolf plans to $$ players towards legendaries, and how they can practically give away common/uncommons.-Eternal requires an internet connection to play, even to PvE or tinker with decks.",1

In addition there is a mobile version.

An active competitive scene with weekly tournaments, limited and constructed ladders to grind, fun decks to build, and good mechanics reminiscent to an improved M:tG, there is little to dislike about this game.The only downside to starting is the cumbersome tutorial, which I (like many others) are hoping will be reworked at some point. Absolutely worth putting in the time to finish it and experience all that this game provides. If you like the genre, you're nuts not to give it a try.",1
16145,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access ReviewI was very happy to see that I played for over 3hrs and was having so much fun that I didnt even notice. Has a nice challenge to it and nice pace. Love the storyline quests also.,1
16146,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI've played a lot of other card games. This card game is the best replacement for MTG fans who loved standard or modern, but couldn't get through the major pay gaps, but hate the uninteractive aspect of other online TCG games like Hearthstone. The biggest difference from MTG is that counterspells can't counter creatures, which, in my eyes, is really nice. Those big creatures that you love to play so much wont be circumvented by a silly 2 drop counter spell in their full hand. THEY ALSO DON'T HAVE A SILLY THOUGHTSEIZE, god I hate going second against someone with a turn 1 thoughtseize.Somethings people can explain/say better than me is about the PVE elements, not to familiar with how they compare to others but I quite enjoyed it.Anyways, I actually enjoy this a lot more than MTG and Hearthstone.",1

The release schedule is just right.  You are never waiting too long for new cards.  The economy is great. Spending a few dollars is worthwhile, but they don't try to gouge you into hundreds just to stay compeitive.  Really easy to be F2P, worthwhile to be ""40 bucks a few times a year"".There are enough play modes to keep me busy all month long, without feeling overwhelmed. Matchmaking is pretty good.

16148,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game has so much done right.  Eliminated a lot of the RNG HStone cards bring .. yet fast play as HStone provides and extra depth that MTG elements bring and yet they failed to improve on the broken land mechanic of MTG.   Its one thing to win or loose a game because you are drawing badly .. or well .. yet to be completely eliminated from the match because 7 lands come up in a row ... I dont know .. MTG is amazing but after all these years you cant tell me someone cant come up with something better because its insanely archaic.  I have build decks explicitly on ""empower"" mechanics and yet there is enough stun / removal so that if you are only drawing lands .. you are dead in the water.  It just seems to happen to often.  Other than that the game is incredibly free to play and has done so much so well ... but the sigil / land mechanic hasnt evolved at all in 25 years.I still think this game is actually great but dayum the land draw is simply horrible and should be a side effect / board.",1
16149,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewTL:DRPros:Decent card gameFamiliar to other TCGsFun and Challenging single playerRegular updatesCons:Some ability definitions arnt clear enoughHaving been a pretty big fan of TCGs when younger, I was excited to have found out about Eternal. At first, it appears to be something similar to a heartstone clone but once you get into the game, it plays much closer to Magic: The Gathering. There are many similar abilities to MTG but just different names with some unique ones that are only really possible due to it being a digital platform for the game.The single player is a solid experience with a story campaign to play through as well as several challenge modes that really make you think outside traditional uses of certain skills in order to win the game. To add to that, there is a Gauntlet mode: Battle through several rounds of NPC opponents with increasing prizes after each win and the risk of being knocked out after 3 losses.While the game does play very similarly to MTG, there are a few things that players will notice are missing. The ability to activate card abilities on the enemies turn is one such difference which can seriously change the pace of the game. (If I am in correct in this statement, please tell me because I wish I could figure out how to do this but it never lets me)",1
16150,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewAs a six year vet of MtG, I have been thrilled with my experience with Eternal. A delightful game that allows the deep complexity of long established TCGs and CCGs in a beautiful and accessable package. Highly recommended.",1

16156,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is the only digital CCG that has kept me coming back to it everytime, because of how amazing the game is. Variance is an issue, but not any more than you would expect from a game that utilizes this mana system.I like that unlike Hearthstone and Shadowverse, the devs take a positive approach to balancing the meta. Instead of releasing overpowered cards before nerfing them, in Eternal, cards tend to be buffed a lot more often than they are nerfed, unless there is a real power level issue. The devs have also made it incredibly easy to build tier decks - their generosity is unlike any other CCG I've played. Of course, legend heavy decks are a long shot, but there are very powerful budget options that still remain tier decks, and that makes up for it. Even then, with some dedicated grinding and smart dusting, you can still craft at least a different legendary playset per week.Nevertheless, gameplay is always fun and varied, draft is the closest you have to an actual MTG draft barring MTGO, and there is support for almost any deck archetype. All in all, a game that will be hard to put down once you pick it up.",1
16157,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewWhat can I say, Eternal is the future of the DCG (Digital Card Game) it has the complexity and stratagy of a good CCG like magic, and adds the convenience of being digital. It is the best choice for people looking for a good digital card game to play competatively, their is a huge and growing tournament scene, and sets being released regularly. So if your looking to escape the cancer that is hearthstone, this is your game!",1
16158,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access ReviewPlayed this game since set 1. Drafting is fun and balancing. The ladder games are not too tedious and in general it is a game I play on and off pretty much every week and still enjoy. So for what thats worth I think it is a very solid game.,1
16159,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI played several CCG and this one simply gives me the best overall experience. To name a few merits:- MTG-like mechanism offers deep strategy choices. It's richer than Hearthstone attacker choice mechanism, and I also like to be able to interact during the attack phase.- F2P friendly. There are many ways to get free cards. It's way more generous than Hearthstone. But legendary cards are still expensive and you often need 4 copies. That's why I mainly stick with aggo decks. Not that I like the aggressiveness, but they often depend on cheaper cards.- Nice UI. The UI is easy to use and it's fast to play. Magic Duels has clumsy UI which breaks the game.- Cross-play between platforms. Half of my playtime was on Android. CCG is the type of game fits mobile phones well and I like to be able to play it any time I want. Gwent is another excellent CCG, but it lacks Android & iOS versions so I didn't invest much time on it.- Deck builder is one of the best I have used. But still I'd like to have more filtering options there, e.g. type of cards, no of mana points... etc. Deck building is half of the game, so a good deck builder really helps.",1
16160,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewBiggest point first: This is the fairest F2P CCG out on the market by far. I played Hearthstone, Duelyst, MTG (Magic: The Gathering), Smite Tacitcs and Elder Scrolls: Legends. For none of the aforementioned was it possible - with some dedication tbf - to grind out a Tier 1 Deck in less than 3 weeks. My average playtime for this period was around 3 hrs a day.If you are on the grindy side of life you can even do it quicker. For me this is one of the very positive sides of the game: You actually CAN grind everything you want with your free time being the only limit. Regarding its game mechanics it is one of the more complex games out there though still much more accessible than MTG. If I'd have to position it between a scale of 1-5 with HS being 1 and MTG being 5 I would rate it around a 3,5.I'm referring to MTG as it has obvious similiarities while still feeling unique on its own. Eternal is ""dumping"" down mechanics, but it cleverly picks mechanics that would be too complex for CCGs and online gaming anyway. For example there are possibilites of interacting on your opponents turn, but it's far more limited than in MTG. Where MTG and it's client lack accessibility and ""smoothness"" in their interface and how the game goes, Eternal seemed to have identified that and fixed it in a very good way. What is mentionworthy too is the point that Eternal uses the same kind of ressource mechanism as in magic playing ""power"" instead of lands. Different words, but the same mechanics, resulting in ""screw"" (shortage of available ressources) or ""flood"" (abundance of ressources but missing out on playable cards).The balance right now is very fine with a lot of decks and strategies viable on ladder. The draft environment is a little bit more polarizing. I personally like it, but it definitely has its weaknesses and players new to the concept of drafting will have problems. I recommend reading a guide if you are interested in drafting, which you probably should be as it is a good way of extending your collection (in contrast to other games you are keeping the cards you drafted during a run).All in all one of the best CCGs out there when it comes down to F2P and mechanics. The art and ""atmosphere"" is a bit lacking though and I hope with a deeper storyline they'll develop more depth there too.For people who wanna start out check the guide on rngeternal: https://rngeternal.com/2017/08/04/eternal-starter-guide/ ",1
16161,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter almost 200 hours and achieving the rank of Master two season's in a row, I feel like I can write a proper review for Eternal. This game is great. It's almost disgustingly free to play. You'll be showered in packs and cards when you first begin, and getting a free card pack on your first ranked win a day has kept me returning time and time again. However, if you're looking for a cheap alternative to Hearthstone, you're probably looking for Shadowverse. Eternal isn't an easy game by any means. The power system is very similar to Magic The Gathering, which can be very off-putting for anyone who hasn't played it before. I believe drawing mana makes the game more complex and allows for a wider array of decks than could ever be achieved in a system that gives you one mana every turn. If the occasional mana flood or mana screw really bothers you, this just isn't going to be the game for you. If you've been looking for a complex CCG with all the deep mechanics of Magic the Gathering while also being very generous in how easy it is to collect, I cannot recommend Eternal enough.TL;DR: Not great if you're just tired of Hearthstone, but if you're willing to sit down and learn it's quirks, there is a truly complex and interesting card game that is very accomodating of small budget.",1
16162,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewGreat game, very generous with giving out cards/stone especially when you are new.

16163,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewOne of my favorite games, hands down. The developers particularly are really excellent and do not try and nickel and dime their players into some Pay 2 Win scheme. I appreciated that so much, I actually did end up purchasing packs. Even still, before then, I had a good number of cards from playing and did not feel overly restricted.Matchmaking is very quick and the multiple modes and events keep it interesting.",1
16164,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is amazing. Having played a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of ccgs (Lists of ones I play include, hearthstone, duelyst, elder scrolls legends, faeria, mtg, deck heroes, pokemon, shadowverse, and probably a few more I cannot think of off the top of my head) the point is, I really enjoy ccgs, and have a lot of experience with them, and in the short time I have played this one, it definitely feels like it is in top 3 ccg's (Duelyst being number 1 still). It seems to be very f2p friendly, giving you a couple decks to start the game with (You get them from doing the campagin) and honestly, those decks are not bad. As well it gives you a fair ammount of packs early game, and given that packs contain 12 cards, a lot more than usual, that is also huge. Plus with game modes like gauntlet, giving you a really good amount of rewards, especially given that it is free at first, getting at least a good enough amount of cards for a reasonable ranked deck, seems very doable. Hell, even with the one it gives you at the beggining, I am managing to win ranked games consistiently. And there is just something about the gameplay, which makes me want to keep coming back, more so than other card games. The♥♥♥♥♥♥that mana works more like mtg rather than hearthstone or simmilair card games, can be a little annoying as it can ♥♥♥♥ you over, but also adds a little more strategy to the game, for example, since when you first draw, they are always on the left hand side of your hand, if your opponent plays one from the far right side of their hand, you can be certain they have a lot more, and therefor not much else. And it is little things like that which make this game one of the better ccg's. Plus it also adds some freshness to the game, so that you are not always allowed to play your 4 drop turn 4, and you may have to adapt to using some cheaper cards to combat with. Plus with the attacking letting your oponent decide whether or not they want  to block, and with cards not being able to block if they attacked the previous turn, it also adds some strategy, in that you need to know whether to attack, and go one offensive, or not so you can defend. All in all I give this game a 9/10 for being one of the better ccg's.",1
16165,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Unfortunately I can't give all you new players, who are hopefully diving in to this with its release, an up to date opionion on starting out, but 1.5 years ago starting out was quite easy and afaik not much, and nothing drastically impactful, has changed since. You're getting nice starter decks and draft tickets and also you have daily packs, quests to save for leagues (sealed) or drafts and two AI modes to grind for gold and packs, also puzzles. At least one of those should be your taste and take you on the road. The game has a great community surrounding it and if you're willing to take your time and a few hints you get online then you're pretty safe to have a very good F2P experience, which I myself have as well. Besides, the world has an interesting flavor in my opinion and Direwolf Digital really stepped up their game with monthly promo cards that you earn along the pack for your first daily win and storys backing them up. The campaigns anachronistically add a lot of great twists to the main story and characters introduced through promo cards that already caught your attention may be visited again, which imo does a great deal to grant immersion.Also community resources are at a peak of availability and creativity, you're also going to get ingame rewards if you're catching the community streaming.The developers have a good sense of humor and they're doing a great job in balancing and advancing the game properly and enjoyably.Give it a try, if you want to be flexible and keep your investments low while still enjoying a top CCG this game deserves a chance.",1
16166,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewSo this is old school creature-based Magic the Gathering, only with abilities and cards you could only do on a computer. Like 'put this card somewhere within your top 10 cards' or 'pull every Yeti in your deck one card closer to the top' or 'add +1/+1 to the top unit or weapon in your deck'. It plays fast and excellent and I've not spent a penny on it yet, but I find myself logging in every day to run through a couple casual games to get a free card pack and clear out my daily quest. Best thing, it's on your smartphone too. It's Hearthstone, only not complete♥♥♥♥♥ Get it.",1
16167,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewHaving played MTG for lots of years, Hearthstone and recently dabbling into Gwent, i can definatly recommend this game to any CCG/ TCG player. The econmy in the game is very very generous compared to Hearstone & Co and its possible to build a competitive deck within a week of playing without investing a single cent in the game. You basically get a free pack every day for your first win and earn gold and cards from chestsfor every following win. There is even the chance that the chests you get upgrade and earn you even more gold, cards or packs.The gameplay is very reminsicent of MTG, which is no wonder considering that a lot of MTG greats like LSV or Patrick Chapin work on this game.There are several game modes where you can play either against other players or the AI.You can can play simple 1 on 1, Draft, Forge (Sealed against the AI), and there are ""Events"" that are only open for a limited time and have specific rules for either gameplay or deckbuilding.  Its even possible to grind for gold against the AI which makes it even easier to build a solid collection.The game is decently balanced and there is a lot of variation on the ladder going on. Last but not least, reaching the Masterrank in Eternal is by far not as big as a grind as reaching Legend in Heartstone or Grandmaster in Gwent and isnt just spamming a lot of games.If youre sick of the RNG and grind in hearthstone, the pirces in MTG or the current state of Gwent i can wholeheartly recomend this game to anyone who loves and plays CCG/ TCGs.",1

16172,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThough Eternal is, as of the time of this review, still technically in Early Access, the game is very polished and quite well done.  I have a played a few other CCGs in additional to Eternal, but I only play Eternal now for two primary reaasons:1. The gameplay is just vastly superior, especially being able to interact on your opponent's turn.2. The F2P model is very generous.  Though I have spent some money to support DWD, I have not really needed it for anything - just playing the game gives you more than enough resources to do whatever you want.  Though there are a few decks that I personally prefer, I have enough in-game resources to build at least 3-4 tier one decks right now if I chose to do so.I have enjoyed playing Eternal very much - the gameplay is solid, the metagame is quite varied, and you really do need to know what you are doing in order to play optimally - your deck does not play itself and even very small decisions can be quite meaningful.",1
16173,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,this is my favorite card game might even be my favorite game period.  i love the mechanics that make it diffrent from magic the gathering like war cry and inspire. but one of the main things i love about this game is that you can unlock everything for free.,1
16174,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"This is better than most TCGs due to better strategies within the variety of cards available.Like most TCGs, it is more pay for less grind than pay to win. If your casual, I would skip unless you don't mind spending a little to get a decent set of cards. I do feel the cards you obtain from campaign and bought card sets are decent to the point you don't need to spend too much initially to get going. I do recommend purchasing one of the discount packs as they are a great deal and you'll have a decent starting cards to create a deck that suites your play style.I previously gave a thumbs down for the draw system. Per their recommendation I looked at their website and got some tips that helped.  It looks like I did need to include search type cards to help situations that result in too much power or units.  Some of the new modes are interesting as well. I changed my recommendation to recommend as this dev is responsive and helpful.Overall, for a TCG, this one has great potential.",1
16175,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewVery nice game, it has a nice variety of playable decks. Very rewarding in contrast with the other card games out there. Definately played as free to play, you can make a playable deck in ranked pretty soon.Totally reccomending it!",1
16176,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game strikes an exciting balance between the complexities of games like Magic: The Gathering and the accessibility of a game like Hearthstone. I'm a huge fan and have gladly put money into this game to support it's development, though you definitely do not have to in order to build up a collection - even with three total sets out!Pros------+ Easy to get started, accessible to new players+ Provides good F2P value - It may not seem like it at first, but once you start rolling through quests and doing Gauntlet and then Forge and gaining ranks in those you will realize how much the packs and Shiftstone (crafting resource) add up over time.+ Short queues - I play at all hours of the day because of the mobile app and average a 20-25 second wait time in both casual and ranked. This might change as you get higher MMR.+ Strong community - There is a tournament series (ETS) and some pretty great community websites. The official Discord server is active, and the websites RNG Eternal and Eternal Warcry are great to help out with determining which decks to work towards+ DRAFTING - Actual drafting. You pass a pack, pick a card, pass a pack, et cetera. Barrier to entry is low, skill ceiling is high. When you start building a collection, this is actually the most efficient way to collect cards (assuming you have mastered both Gauntlet and Forge already). Simply draft all the rares and build the best deck you can after that. Sometimes you end up going 2-3 wins or even more, which is just icing on the cake since you keep your cards and get the value of opening 4 packs.+ Strong playstyle variety - I'm not talking which decks are tier 0-1, I'm talking about the different styles of decks out there. You can comfortably play aggro decks, burn decks, midrange decks, combo decks, and control decks. There are viable lists out there for all of these playstyles. There are even options within those options. Right now there is a control deck that plays zero creatures. There is also one that relies on developing control of the board and then dropping an overwhelming force of high value and hard to remove creatures.Cons------- The tutorial is ♥♥♥♥ing LONG - Honestly, just power through it. It sucks. It's way too long. We've all done it and it's not fun. But once you finish that and all the modes and options of this game open up to you, it suddenly becomes worth it.- Operates on a ""mana"" system like Magic - This means you can get games where you get flooded or screwed. Games where you draw nothing but power or don't draw any power really feel bad to lose.- Deck size is high - This is debatable, and LSV, one of the designers, has stuck by the decision to keep the deck size at 75 for constructed. It introduces some variability to the game and makes it harder to consistently draw the answers you need.",1

Mechanically, it's better than Hearthstone, and it's very generous to players in terms of card and pack drops, so you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars to build a good deck like you do with Magic. Also, unlike MtG Arena, this actually has a good user interface.It's a bit slow to start off, with five campaigns that unlock your five starter decks, but from there on it's great. First PVP win of the day nets you a pack of twelve cards (one of which will be a rare or legendary) and sometimes a promotional card (if you miss these, you can later craft them for slightly less of the in-game resource than a rare). Between this, progression rewards, and daily quests, it's not hard to build up a sizable collection of cards fairly quickly, and without dropping a single real-world dollar/pound/etc.",1

16187,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,The only reason you would bother with a different CCG or TCG or whatever you want to call it is because this doesn't have 2 player friendly co-op for 4-man games like Magic TG does.Seriously. That's the only reason. There is absolutely no other reason to play any other card game but this one. It doesn't f*ck you at every turn for money. It's got good pacing. It's got complexity. It's aesthetically pleasing. It allows for deck building in just about any way you want. It's system for breaking cards down and making new ones you actually want puts all others to shame.So yeah...I guess the only reason it doesn't have co-op is because then no other CCG on the planet would ever be played anymore and they're too nice to do that to everyone.,1

The draft mode is incredibly expensive in currency with very little currency reward, so it's not sustainable in and of itself.

This hurts extra much if you hade to pay (in game currency) to enter Forge or Draft mode.No matter how much time you tweak and tinker your decks to perfection, there is still a change that you are power starved.Example: 1There is a risk of getting stuck on 2 power even if your deck is 1 colored and all your cards cost 3 you can still lose the game due to not drawing a powercard in 10 consecutive turns.Example: 2  You have a multi colored deck of 2 colors (lets say green and blue). (Then the problem will be influence related, which type of fraction you can spend you power on)There is a risk that you only draw green cards and only get blue influence the entire game. Even if you have taken extreme measures with the deck building to counter this problem.Here is just me cying a little etra to get it out of my head ;) (sorry):""Me personally, can have 4 cards out of 75 that cost 8 mana and all other cards cost 3, I will still dra all 4 of the 8 cost card as initial hand every game all the time.""",1

Then I grind out dalies and draft, get some cards, become optimistic.Then I play the actual game and realize the game basically boils down to drawing answers, did you do it more than your opponent? You win, did he/she, they win, that's basically it. The power/land system just makes this more prominent.I'm sure at high level tournament play there is a great metagame and card selection matters but the ladder just requires adaptable good decks, and when those spar you might as well just flip a damn coin because everyone knows how to pilot their deck after the first couple games, so getting to a higher rank is basically just stomaching variance and hoping you drew better than your opponent.

16196,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"I've been playing for over a year and even though there are things that bother me I still really enjoy this game. I initially started playing because of how generous the game is (at least one free pack a day) but I kept playing because of how fun it was. There are numerous single player modes (that give prizes) to build up as your skills.  Besides the standard modes to play against players they also run limited time events you can buy into with gold. I love how they keep the community engaged by periodically releasing ""promo"" cards for a limited time that you get with only one win. I do have two big complaints about the game.  The first is that when you hit a non-game where you have too much or too little power it's incredibly frustrating not being able to do anything. I understand that is a part of card games but why can we have a first draw that is only one power? I always reject those. The second issue I have is that there are combos (mostly with infiltrate) that bring you down from high health to death in one turn.  It can be a SLOW process watching one card get played over and over and over again. You would think these would be nerfed but that's not always the case.

16203,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access Review(Don't let my hours played fool you, I have around 100+ hours on mobile since I tend to play more on mobile than on steam.)Easily the best online card game I have played to date. I have played tons of Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone over the years and Eternal is a great blend between both games. It is more similar to MTG in terms of how attacking/defending and mana works and in my opinion that is a great thing. -Eternal is super generous as it makes it super easy to earn gold and cards.-Tons of different game modes (draft, forge, ranked,....)-Unlike arena in Hearthstone the drafting in this game is more like MTG's drafting AND you get to keep all the cards you earn along with gaining rewards. -Lots to do against the A.I in case you don't want to play against real people or you don't want to have to worry about roping and losing your turn.-PROMO CARDS. Eternal periodicaly adds new cards to the game in between expansions to shake up the meta which is super nice.-As of right now the devs actually buff and nerf cards decently often.-There is an andriod beta app already out which makes playing the game on the go easy.-There is an actual playerbase. A lot of card games suffer by having such a tiny playerbase but Eternal consistantly has 1,000+ players on steam plus more on mobile. Honestly I would recommend this game to everyone that even remotely likes card games.",1
16204,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI've got about 30 hours in Eternal on mobile, and another 20 hours here on Steam. I've spent ~13€ on ingame currency to unlock a solo campaign (that I have yet to finish) and buy a few boosters. And yet, I just uninstalled the game on all my devices. Because of two reasons. There's a TL;DR at the bottom.First, there's the monetization. Sure, the game gives you twice as many cards as comparable games for free. Daily boosters, quests for more, and rapid gain of gold for even more. You gain cards at a rapid pace without paying a dime.But there's a reason for that. The deck sizes. Constructed Decks in Eternal consist of 75 (SEVENTY FIVE) cards minimum. 25 (TWENTY FIVE) of them are REQUIRED to be power/mana/lands, which leaves you with 50 (FIFTY) cards to build your actual deck out of.You can add up to 4 copies of each card to your deck, no matter the rarity. And because of the massive deck size, you HAVE to add at least 3 copies of a card to have any reasonable chance to see it. So just throwing a single copy of a legendary into a deck won't do you any good. You need 3. You want 4. Now let's go back to all those boosters you get.Cards in Eternal come in four rarities. Common, Uncommon, Rare and Legendary. You're guaranteed a Rare in every booster, and boosters usually have 3 uncommons as well, plus eight commons, for a total of 12 cards. The chances for the uncommon being a legendary are roughly 1 in 10 (tested on reddit with 500 packs) or 10%. You have no influence on which Legendary that is gonna be. Sure, you can also turn duplicates and unwanted cards into dust, but crafting a legendary costs 3200 dust while destroying a common or uncommon card gives 1 or 10 dust, respectively. Destroying unwanted legendaries gives 800 dust. You also get 100 dust per booster you open.So in order to get those 3 legendaries, for your deck, you'll have to open a ♥♥♥♥ton of boosters. And as you can imagine, pretty much all the top decks run at least 1 legendary (and 4 copies of it), if not more. So, sure, on paper, Eternal gives you more cards than other digital tcgs. But because of it's massive deck sizes and no limit on legendaries per deck, you'll have to invest a lot of cash to get a properly competitive deck before you reach pension age.Second, the power/mana/land mechanic.In theory, it's fun. A little strategic element, especially since most decks run at least two colours and thus have to juggle between the cards. But in praxis, this is where the huge decksize comes in again.75 cards, of which 25 are power/mana/lands. Those are the minimum numbers. One third of your deck NEEDS to be power/mana/lands. And because the decks are so massive, there's a huge chance that there will be extended dry spells or floods of power/mana/land.During my 50 hours of total playtime, roughly 40% of games were won or lost because either me or my enemy could not play any cards for several turns in a row. Either because we had played all our power/mana/land cards and weren't drawing new ones, or because we had played all the cards we could play and were only drawing power/mana/lands. For several turns in a row. My personal record is EIGHT TURNS of nothing but power/mana/lands.That's no fun. I want to win and lose games because of the decks I and my opponent built. NOT the RNG deciding I don't get to play anything this turn. And the next turn. And the next turn. And the...This is a digital card game! There are ways around that issue. Allow me to skip powers on draw if I want, be it by putting them under the deck or into the void. Allow me to polymorph the next card I draw into a power card, without telling me what it is beforehand. Something like that. Just don't let me lose three games in a row again because I only draw powers/mana/lands!My second complaint with the game could be fixed, if the devs care enough about it. It seems to be a common reason for people getting frustrated with it and dropping bad reviews.The first complaint, however, is something intrinsic to the game that can't be changed until massive changes are amde, which I don't see.Maybe I'll revisit Eternal if they fix the power/mana/land issues. It is a lot of fun when it isn't completely frustrating, after all. But the frankly insidious business model that also feeds into the power/mana/land issue is making my return unlikely.TL;DRDecks are too big, Legendaries are too rare and you need four copies of the same one in a deck, Mana floods/screws are waaaaaay too common.",0

It is very generous with giving out cards, including free decks every few days, and has a good draft mode that lets you keep the cards you draft, even if you lose.Only major gripe i can say, is that you will sometimes run into mana problems, due to your resources being entirely based on your luck of the draw. This can really frustrate games, where you run into extreme resource shortages or over-abundances. It is a fairly serious problem, as deck shuffling is entirely too RNG at times.If you do decide to play, the referral system, it provides free decks to starting players which is great.",1

The game is also extremely generous for a F2P entry and gives you tons of ways to earn coins and packs.There are so many ways to play!1. Campaigns. Free to enter. A short set of campaigns against AI opponents that guide you through game mechanics. They are a little boring and could use some rework, as they've been around for a long time. You get rewarded with a basic card pool.2. Puzzles. Free to enter. 80 puzzles centered around game mechanics that teach you corner cases and nuances. A blast to play, and you get rewarded with a good bit of gold.3. Gauntlet. Free to enter. Most useful gold farming mode. You face off 7 AI opponents and are challenged to beat them all without losing. Doing so net's you a 'rank up' containing packs and gold until you heart max rank (master). After master, you can still grind gauntlet for the rewards of two silver chests containing gold.4. Forge. Free to enter. Mix between draft and sealed like Hearthstone's Arena, you pick one of three given cards until you end up with a 25 card deck. You face AI opponents until you either win seven or lose 2. If you win seven, you rank up just like gauntlet.5. Draft. 5k gold to enter. Draft a card from a booster pack and pass the rest to your neighbor, until you have drafted 40+ card. Make a deck and then play other players. 7 wins or 3 losses. 3 wins and you are ahead. 7 wins and you get a ton of stuff! Your win record is tracked and you are ranked from bronze to master.6. Casual. Free to enter. Constructed play against another player but your win record/rank isn't recorded. Minimal rewards from winning, but great to try out decks or get used to constructed.7. Ranked. Free to enter. Constructed play against another player and your win record is recorded. Winning can rank you up from bronze to master. Gauntlet has better gold/minute but trying to hit diamond/master in ranked is a challenge of it's own. 8. Events. Variable cost to enter. The devs run events (usually 1-2 a month) with special deck construction rules (i.e. mono color decks only) or play rules (draw 2 cards a turn). Variables prizes, but almost always worth doing.If you are starting out, play gauntlet until you get to gold or diamond and are having a hard time winning. Then play forge to master. Then return to gauntlet. Then draft until you run out of gold. Then play gauntlet and ranked and save gold to draft more. Somewhere in there do some fun puzzles.At the end of each month you get rewarded packs for your ranked and draft ranks.I've only played for a couple of months, and I have 3 fully built tier 1-2 constructed decks, and am working on #4.

16215,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is a very fun card game. It's got complexity and variety. Compared to other online card games, I think this is probably the best I've played. Deck building is the most fun I've had in a while. Deck size and limits are sufficiently big to let you experiment, while most cards are balanced against each other, thus letting you build interesting and unique decks. The game has just had one expansion, and already there's a huge number of viable and competitive decks out there. The best thing about it is that the game doesn't encourage aggro decks (nor does it discourage it. It's perfectly viable to play any kin of deck.Cards don't depend so much on RNG, like they do in Hearthstone. What they do is clear from the beginning. As a result you don't feel you depend on luck as much as you depend on your wits. The only luck aspect of the game is what cards you draw (more on that later).There is no deck limit. You can have as many decks as you like. Guess what Blizzzard, no one is getting confused.Perhaps the most important feature of the game is that it's not Pay2Win. It's Play2Win. There's a lot of ways to gain gold, cards and packs that don't involve you paying for it every time. First of all, there's an exclusive game mode (Gauntlet), which you can play for free and as many times as you like. You battle against 7 AI opponents, and each victory grants you a reward chest. Depending on how well you went, you get an appropriate reward, and it's very easy to gather gold if you are willing to grind for it. It's not boring either, because the AI opponents are random and are actually competent at the game. Then aside from Gauntlet there are two other modes, where you need to pay gold (or real money) to enter: Draft and Forge. Forge works like Hearthstone's Arena, only you battle against AI opponents again. Draft works like MTG Draft games and here you get to fight against real humans. What's so great about these modes? Well aside from the final rewards you can get, YOU CAN KEEP ALL THE CARDS THAT YOU DRAFTED. That's right, you pay 2500 gold (Forge) or 5000 gold (Draft) and you get to pick cards according to your collection's needs. Buying packs is 1000 gold, and you get 10 cards per pack, which is well worth it. And then to top all this off, every single victory you make in Ranked or Casual play will reward you with some gold and a single card (at the very least, there's a good chance you can get a card pack out of it). I haven't payed a single dime so far, and I have a very respectable collection. I only started playing a couple weeks ago.The only real money you pay is for cosmetic stuff. And honestly, this game is so great and I appreciate the fact that it doesn't hound me to pay it money all the time, that I will indeed give it some. The devs have earned it.The game looks and sounds great. The card art is interesting, the animations and sound design are really nice and the overall atmosphere is just enticing you to keep playing.There are no bugs that I have noticed so far. Haven't had a single disconnect or server issue.Its only downsides for me are:- Constantly drawing mana cards can screw you over occasionally. There are no reshuffling mechanics in place. Decks require you to have 1 mana card in every 3 cards which can expound the problem. It's not such a big deal though because this is something that can happen in any card game using mana cards. The reverse can also happen occassionally. It's just luck of the draw.- Rumor has it that applications that help you keep track of your cards can get you banned. I can't confirm this, but if it's true, it's a bit of a headscratcher.- The ladder system needs a bit of a rework. The game can harshly penalize you for each loss, but you don't get an equivalent reward for each win. You can be winning more than 50% of your games and still not climbing the ladder.Overall though, these are minor things in the grand scheme of things. The game itself is amazingly enjoyable. I highly recommend it to anyone interested getting in a new card game.",1

Major differences from Hearthstone:- Combat happens in a similar way to Magic: you choose the attackers and then your opponent chooses which creatures blocks which.- Damage from combat is NOT permanent.- Uses the concept of lands (called sigils in this game)- Multicolor decks- Less focus on RNG- Fast spells (spells that you can cast when your opponent declares an attack / ends the turn)They took Hearthstone and then tried to make it feel a little bit more like Magic.

Plays very similar to Magic the Gathering if you are familiar with that game, but takes great advantage of the digital medium.

This game is also extremely generous with it's free to play model, and it does not take very long at all to collect/craft the cards you need for competitive decks.

My only gripes are that some of the art is a bit too cartoony like Hearthstone(Gotta give it to M:TG for their amazing artwork) and that the competitive meta gets stale in between set releases.

16236,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewSimilar to Magic the Gathering but with several significant improvements, imo.* The model legitimately alows free to play playstyle, and the game is INCREDIBLY generous with how many cards it gives you.  Compared to hearthstone, your rate of card acquisition is immensely more satisfying, and compared to Magic, its just so much less abusive towards players wallets.* The game takes full advantage of being a digital card game, with many very interesting mechanics involving state changes to cards out of play, which would not be possible in a a physical card game.  I find the mechanics more interesting than those in most MtG sets.* The mulligan rule is far superior to Magic's, providing a free mulligan into a hand guaranteed to have 2-4 'lands'.  WHile I wish the game pushed even harder towards avoiding manascrew, I find that a lot less games in Eternal than in Magic have a player unable to play the game due to Manascrew/flood.  Essentially, if you want to play a very interesting Magic format without it destroying your wallet, Eternal is for you.",1
16237,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewVery good game, massive improvement in the FTP model versus Hearthstone. I also find the mana system to be another layer of deckbuilding strategy, versus the annoyance some people see it as.",1
16238,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewVery simply a great digital CCG which plays very similarly to Magic. The fact that your account carries over to mobile is a HUGE plus as i usually play it to and from work. Its F2P friendly with rather generous features that help new players add to their collection. The option to combine factions brings a whole different dimension to deck building which keeps the game fresh and allows great flexibility in building interesting decks.Compared to the current king-of-the-hill ""Hearthstone"", Eternal loses out in terms of over polish and UI interactions on the game play board, but blows Hearthstone out of the water in terms of laddering, deck creation and most importantly cost.

16239,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewTLDR : depth of MtG + digital smoothness of HS = muy buenoBackground : I've been playing this game in closed beta since May 2016. I had over 3000 games played until the wipe and open beta. in 2015 I was a die hard Duelyst fan, but have since completely switched over, and I don't see myself moving anytime soon.Eternal is a thinking man's CCG for the digital age, and it's the real deal. It may not necessarily be for everyone, but :- If you enjoy card game but get frustrated at HS, Duelyst, Shadowverse and consorts for their shallowness and RNG cards, this is definitely something you want to look into. - From the other end of the spectrum, if you enjoy MtG but (rightfully) hate MODO and pretty much every digital iteration of the ancestral TCG, this is absolutely for you too.Eternal is a Johnny's dream come true. The deckbuilding possibilities are endless. It's also fantastic to Spikes, I hear, what with the great balance and very low level of card RNG (yes this game has mana screw RNG, which will make you rage a lot if you come over from the HS/Duelyst/etc side, but with how low the RNG levels are through the rest of the game, skill-winrate correlation is still higher here than in any other card game I'm familiar with).Make sure to join the Discord server when you get started !

16241,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewIt's my favourite Digital CCG so far. Magic inspired mechanics, lots of combo potential and good Free to Play content.EDITSo, since MtG Arena is so close now, I tought I'd update this review to highlight better why I like this game a lot over magic.This game is pretty much what MtG would be if it was made for pc in the first place. You can send tokens to your graves, you can duplicate cards, you can permanently change stats of cards on the board but also in the grave, your hand or the deck. All kind of fun things that will never be possible in Magic.The other ""upside"" is that the gameplay is streamlined compared to Arena. If you saw the gameplay of Arena, you know the obnixious amount of times you have to press ""next"" if you attack while you have a instant in you hand. That's not a thing in Eternal. It removes some (just a few really) options from you but makes the game play much better.So, no, it's not Magic. It doesn't have the insane amount of cards. You can't cast instants between every single substep or you opponents turn. But it does play very smooth and have a lot of new tricks availlable to you. It's still my favourite card game and I encourage you to try it!",1
16242,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewFor someone who dislikes the toxicity of multiplayer games... Eternal is to some degree a breath of fresh air. The singleplayer content is awesome... I love digital card games that embrace the singleplayer experience! The game itself has the complexity of MtG, but the accessibility of Hearthstone. I don't get why this game isnt more well recieved.",1
16243,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewTo be brief, you will LOVE this game the first few hours playing it. It seems perfect and balanced and enjoyable, without random effects ruining the game. I enjoyed a lot the first 30 hours of game, until that point was a ""DEFENITLY RECOMMEND""However, as you progress you will hit one REALLY FRUSTRATING thing about this game. Rare cards are made overpowered, and there is no chance in hell you will get them unless you either open your wallet or spend hundreds of hours farming and being beaten by players who just have those cards.For example, a card that's super rare (and thus wallet warriors have), cost only 4 to invoke and has 5/6 stats AND also disables all flying units you may have, where all the normal cards costing 4 power have usually around 3/3 stats and do nothing.This applies in a lot of cards, where all the ""really freaking awesome cards"" are just available for long time players or wallet warriors, and you will hit that wall and you will quit this game.That said, I have to say that I really enjoyed the first 30 hours for a free game, but this is as far as I go.",0
16244,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI wish the reviews had a neutral option. The game has so much potential and with a few tweaks could be the top CCG. It by far has the best single player & AI of any game in the genre. There is a very fun and free single player mode vs the ai that gives you lots of cards / gold. They are very generous and make the collection building much easier than other games. The ranked system is actually very well done. You need 100 points to rank up and every win gives you some points and a loss takes some away. You gain more points for wins than points loss for losing. I have a few key issues with this game which is the main reason I only really play to do daily quest now and instead play Elder Scrolls Legends with most of my time. Elder Scrolls Legends is by far the bes CCG available and it's a shame nobody has heard of. It's kind of funny that Dire Wolf is also doing Elder Scrolls, but yet that game blows away Eternal. Anyway, let's get into the actual problem. The decks are just too large with 70 cards, but they do allow for up to 4 copies of each card. Carrying 4 copies of each with 70 cards is NOT the same as having a 35 card deck with 2 copies of each. Your extra copies or even all of the copies of 1 card can and often do end up in the latter 2/3rds of the deck which never see play. There are just too many total cards to be able to have very consistent gameplay. I have spent a little over half of my time playing ranked matches and I have had only a couple of games that actually felt like good solid games on both sides. Just for a comparison, Elder Scrolls has almost every game feel like a good close game with the winner being determined based on skill more than rng. The other 99% of games were just blowout wins or losses. Too often the game is decided in the opening hand. Whoever wins or loses is more often a question of which player gets a better distribution of their sigils rather than who actually played better or had a better constructed deck.You put 50 cards into the deck and then you are forced to put at least 25 Sigil cards. If you want to play a 1 cost unit then you must first play 1 sigil. To play a 2 cost unit requires you to have played 2 total sigils and you can only play 1 sigil per turn. In theory this is a good idea, but their system needs some serious tweaking to make the gameplay feel balanced. 90% of the games end with 50+ cards left into the deck. Too often you will have cards in your hand, but then can't play them because you draw a sigil for 6 turns in a row. The other thing that happens is that you only draw minions / spells, but no sigils. I hate winning a game for no reason other than my opponent drew sigils for 6 straight turns while I bashed his face in. I also equally hate losing for this same reason.  The mulligan system will allow you to either keep or replace all of your cards which does not help these things from happening. If the developers will fix the sigil issue and cut the size of the deck by about 10 cards then would be a perfect game.  The way the game is right now I would recommend it if you like Magic as it's really close in gameplay or hate the other CCGs you're currently playing. You would be better off checking out Elder Scrolls Legends because until this game is more balanced, ESL is just a better game all around.",1
16245,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewFirst of all, while this game does have its ""minuses"" (-/-), it has more than enough ""pluses"" (+/+) to balance, if not negate the minuses altogether. Most importantly, this game really is ""Free to Play"". Really. Unfortunately, this automatically implies that there ARE or WILL BE in-game purchases, and, while I did download this game from the Steam PC Platform, I can't stress enough that [in-app purchases] are O-P-T-I-O-N-A-L to play (and consequently enjoy...) the game and, moreso, the concept (and the caveats) behind in-app purchases have been universally understood since the inception of both the AppStore and Google Play stores, so disregard any negative reviews driven by a 'pay to win' policy. Next, any kind of fan-from hobbyists to expert collectors-of MTG (Magic: The Gathering) know that this game does not, in any way, duplicate the card game (or any equivalent apps), because THERE ARE NO duplicates of MTG, whatsoever, but I digress. So, first, the ""pluses"" (+/+). Right out of the gate, the artwork and cinematics are amazing, a kin to scenes and character designs in a graphic novel, and with just enough [character] cell animation that the art seems 3-D, but still looks 2-D. The story, as a whole, from the beginning, draws the player into the storyline itself, without too much emphasis on any particular character or scene. On the other hand, some of the cut scenes and individual characters' storylines, while they do meld with each other as a whole, may cause a player to pause or rewind scenes in order to recall the significance of some these individual characters along the way. Overall though, the story is an 8 out of 10. Second, the gameplay is very immersive and, even if you don't normally play CCGs, simple to understand as a whole, whether you're a [CCG] hobbyist or full-time player; the gameplay, 8 out of 10. One of my personal favorite features of the UI (User Interface) is the explanation of the cards (both your cards and the cards your enemy has just played); e.g. if a card has a character with an effect that you don't recognize, rolling over the card will bring up it in detail and also, briefly explain any ""foreign"" terms used on the card, allowing the player to learn the finer aspects of the cards that make up the decks quicker... and without Google. Third is a feature familiar to all, but often overlooked during the review process: the in-game menu. As it is (and as it should stay), the in-game menu is the classic 'continue playing or quit' layout, as opposed to several other games where a menu goes to another menu, and another, and another, etc., As an integral part of the game and its overall UI, the layout of the game itself gets a 10 out of 10. Finally, the only downside to this game is inside the tutorial. The tutorial, as a whole, does a great job at introducing new users to the game and the storyline within; a common theme, however, is that during the 'tutorial' process while [you] are battling storyline characters to advance and learn the game, the tutorial pretty much stops ""tutoring"" you in a part of the main story while playing a character named Eilyn, causing the difficulty to immoderately skip from almost too easy to hard without any warning, which forces the individual players in an almost repetative fashion to teach themselves the more articulate concepts of CCGs, such as overall strategy, deck building, the concept of sacrifice for success, etc., which was the most frustrating part of the learning process; as such, unfortuantely, I have to give the gameplay 7 out of 10. So, overall (and if you're still reading), the game as it is, and for what it is, is a SOLID 8.5 out of 10, 43 out of 50, 85 out of 100, etc., etc. As such, I would recommend this game to any newcomers, either to Steam or CCGs. And just remember, ANY game out there that is considered ""Free to Play"" will always be pay to win, regardless of the genre, if you have a big enough wallet; the in-app or in-game purchases don't ever effect the quality of the game, only the quality of the gamer.

They like to boast that it was designed by MTG pros. Which is funny, because it's almost cut and paste from MTG mechanics. So yeah, great job pros. They managed to steal the resource system from Hex though, so at least they shopped around.The only reason this game has positive reviews is because of the F2P system. Everyone loves free @#$% right? Quality isn't an issue then. If you want a better game with a fair F2P model that actually takes some skill (unlike this screw/flood garbage game) go spend your time with Faeria. If you want quick matches and a fair F2p system try Shadowverse.

16257,Eternal Card Game,,"Card Game is for sure MY favorite digital Collectible/Trading Card Game (CCG/TCG). It's super free-to-play friendly and you consistently get free packs & cards over time. Even in the beginning, you don't feel like you are completely outmatched just because someone has rarer cards in their deck than you. You can play ""budget"" decks (see https://eternalwarcry.com/decks?dn=budget) and still win with a good strategy.It's a bit closer to Magic the Gathering (MTG) than simpler card games like Hearthstone and Shadowverse in that you still draw power cards rather than gain power evenly each turn, but there are a lot more mechanics compared to MTG that reduce how often you draw too little or too much power. It's also more like MTG in that it's more complex than the other digital CCG options out there. One major benefit over MTG is that this is strictly a digital game, so you have fun mechanics that would be very hard to pull off for MTG since that still has to cater to a physical card game. For example, stats on ""killed"" units remain even if the card returns from the ""void.""Just recently (Dec 2018), a new set of cards has come out that has really added to the deck-building options. It feels like the popular decks are always changing and you have many different options with the type of game you can play and that one type of deck isn't always the winner.You are definitely rewarded for playing against other players, but, especially in the beginning and after a new set is released, playing against the AI is fun and gives you a lot of cards. The reason is that when you draft cards, unlike other games, they are permanently added to your deck. How cool is that?Definitely try it. It's free-to-play and you NEVER feel pressured to put money into the game. You can play on iOS, Android, Steam, & Xbox and they are always kept in sync and all rewards are available on all platforms. Achievements sync too (except Xbox). PvP play is cross-platform.Note that you get a free preconstructed deck by using a referral code to sign up (I don't want to post my code but feel free to message me for it if you found my review helpful; I'd appreciate it). That said, don't feel bad if you didn't get the deck. You can get all those cards fairly quickly even if you don't use a referral link.The game does make you play the first six or so games of the tutorial, but after that you can skip the tutorial from the settings menu if you don't want to complete it. Also check out Reddit for a really cool community and more information. There are also a couple links there to free promotions that get a free campaign. You can also get other campaigns by spending in-game currency that you gain just by playing; as I said, you don't have to pay anything. There are some extra visual items that you can purchase (deck backs, etc.), but they have absolutely no bearing on gameplay and they are strictly there if you want to change some cosmetic feature and/or support the developers. Even without spending money, new cosmetic options are available to you fairly often.Again, the current player-base would love to see the community grow. Many players are very pro and competitive, but are great to learn from and super friendly. I am more casual, but really enjoy the strategy of this type of card game. I also feel the art style is really cool without being too weird, gross, or overtly sexualized. I wouldn't feel weird about others seeing me play this game, unlike a couple other CCGs out there.",1

Yeah sure, it saves waiting time, but it makes the format pointless.Even I managed to go 7-1 in my first ""draft"", I was upgraded to silver rank (and then gold) soon and then it became really hard.By that time, I still found that the game was kind of fun, and decided to buy the founder pack, to get the campaign cards quickly. 5 days later I completely regret the desision. This game is not for me. I do not like magic anymore, I played Magic the Gathering (father of that type of card games) for 15 years and I have been off Magic for another 10. With all the possibilities, why dont you have creativity to improve on the format, not just offering the same game.And yeah, I dont like merhcant cards in constructed (units that access your ""sideboard"" during the game). I dont like the mana screws.  I dont like the sites mechanic (pwoerful castle that casts free spell each turn, ending with powerful champion). Nothing about this game's gameplay is, that I can really recommend. And UI. It is really hard to figure out how to use UI for some of the more complicated targeting spells. Prepare to get several losses before you figure that all out.",0
16261,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI'm a dedicated F2P card gamer, coming from a background in MTG, Hearthstone, and Yugioh primarily. I, like many of you, have been scouring the web for a new card game to play, after mounting frustration with the absurd cost of other card games. This review's for my other competitive F2P gamers that are deciding whether or not to give this one a go. TL;DRAfter spending ~30 hrs in Eternal toying with all the modes and features, I'm giving it a cautious thumbs up. It offers a variety of gameplay modes with good strategic depth, and is quite generous to new and F2P players. However, the mana system at the core of the game can be game ruining due to its RNG; players will inevitably have some games where they lose or win because of mana flood or mana drought, which may be a dealbreaker for some.Pros:+++ Two incredible drafting modes: forge (vs. AI) and draft (PVP). Some of the best I've seen in any card game. Forge is reminiscent of Arena in HS, allowing the player to form a one or two color deck from 25 3-card picks. Draft plays more like an MTG draft, where packs of cards are passed between players. Both modes allow players to keep the cards they pick, and offer additional scaled rewards for number of wins, which is incredibly generous and refreshing. Other digital CCGs should take note. +++ Very welcoming to new players, especially F2P. Astounding generosity when it comes to in-game resources (cards, packs, gold, etc). F2P gamers don't need to spend a dime to build viable decks.++ Deep strategic play (RNG of mana aside). Many opportunities for satisfying counterplays and fun combos. Winning often requires a combination of careful offensive and defensive maneuvers.  ++ Vast variety of game modes to suit every taste. Casual and ranked PVP, multiple drafting modes, and helpful skill-building AI and puzzle modes. ++ Good deckbuilding. Five color factions ala MTG, which allows for creative combinations. Most cards can be viable in at least a certain deck or two, which is refreshing, especially if you're coming from Hearthstone where some cards clearly and consistently outclass others.++ Devs and customer support are active, which is a great sign for an early access game. They just released their third expansion in Dec 2017. I almost lost my account when I first started playing, and the support team responded quickly  and helped me retrieve it, so shout out to them.+ Cool art, decent voice acting. Those that care about that sort of thing will appreciate the diversity of characters and creatures. I personally appreciate how the female characters are portrayed.Cons: - - - The mana system. This is by far my biggest complaint, and the number one thing that will keep many players from enjoying the game. Power cards, as Eternal calls them, function extremely similarly to land in MTG; you have to draw and play them to build your mana pool in order to play cards from the five color factions. The potential for mana drought and mana flooding is high. I have lost and won games in ranked and other modes because of this, which is incredibly frustrating. This part of the game could use a rework.- - Not as polished as other older, more established games. Expected given its early access state, but may be a turn off for some players.- - No cap on legendaries. More seasoned players may disagree with me on this point, but I think its vital for new and/or F2P players to know. You can run 4 copies of any card in your deck including legendaries, which means top tier ranked decks tend to have 4 copies of at least a few different legendaries. If it were up to me, I would put a 1 or 2 copy cap on these cards, because I think it'd help out newer players and encourage deckbuilding creativity.  - Relatively small player base. The game is growing, but it doesn't have the queue times of more established CCGs.ConclusionI hope this has been helpful! Overall, I think Eternal is worth playing in spite of its flaws, and I look forward to what the devs have in store. Recommended to players who... are F2P. enjoy the collection aspect of CCGs. enjoy the drafting modes offered in other card games. are frustrated with Hearthstone's scant rewards and high cost.  want to play something similar to Magic without draining their wallet. are a fan of strategy games enjoy building a variety of decks.Not recommended to players who... find mana RNG too frustrating. aren't fond of large decks. are inexperienced with deckbuilding. want a finished, completely polished game. desire an established metacommunity (with tons of streamers, websites, tournaments, etc) like Hearthstone or Magic have.

16262,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewSo i have played this game a little bit now and i must say I do not think i would keep playing or recommend itLet's start with the good things though :-The reward system is great-The free to play is really good, you can collect cards really quick if you are good at forge and draft-It has very creative cards and effects-Good depth of strategyBut that is already it.Now to the bad part :-I said that collecting cards is easy, but you also need to purchase campains to unlock certain cards, the problem is that those cost a ridiculous amount of gold and the amount of gold you spend on them is amounts of gold you do not spend on the rest of your collection through forge and draft-The imbalance in cards is incredible some cards are so overpowered that you have to either include them or fill your decks with answers to them or almost instantly lose the moment they are played, and since there is such an imbalance many of the rather fun and/or meme cards are left in the dust reducing the amount of different decks you can face and therefor lowering your overall enjoyment in ranked.-Deck building freedom is very sevrely limited. As said previously some cards are so overpowered (tavrod, sandstorm titan ...) that you need to either pack some answers to them in your deck or face an instant loss. So already a large part of your deck if you play control will be dedicated to not be overrun by aggro and answering all the overpowred cards thrown at you that leaves you with either the standart deck size which forces you to pack just whats the strongest for your deck or play a deck with more cards severely lacking consistency-Some mechanics are 100% worthless like reckless and some mechanics like aegis are completely busted forcing you to pack some answers for it aswell again limiting deck creativity-Also the deck system is a real pain to deal with. I play a standard deck size of 75 cards, you need at least 25 power cards, which is what most people play with, i already pack 26 power cards in my deck along with 43 cards that cost less than 5 mana, and it is not rare for me to not draw any power cards or drawing all my lategame cards before turn 7 therefor getting run over by aggroTL;DR : Very good free to play system, creative effects of cards but too much imabalnce, forced deck building, bad deck system",0
16263,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewA very fun CCG with mechanics in line with Magic (5 colors of mana, mana cards have to be drawn, defender chooses blockers, instant cast spells usable on opponent's turn, etc). The initial intro with the starter decks is a little tedious, but once you get past that the game is shockingly fair for a free to play game.For single player content, you have the Gauntlet and the Forge. The Gauntlet is free and pits your constructed deck against up to 7 AI in a row (one loss and you start over) for progressively better rewards (gold, cards, card packs if you win all 7). The Forge lets you draft cards to play 7 games against the AI and ends if you lose twice. You keep ALL the cards you draft and can also win 3-4 card packs and a chunk of gold (buy in is 2.5 packs worth of gold), making this a great way to build your collection while learning the game.Multiplayer currently has Ranked and Draft, with each ranked win giving gold / cards (sometimes a pack with a lucky roll) and Draft is like the Forge on steroids, with you drafting (and keeping!) a larger number of cards to create your deck.I've been collecting cards so fast I felt obligated to send some money the dev's way, which is a hell of a contrast from many other games in this genre.",1
16264,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFirst thing first, THIS IS AN ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME GAME AND YOU MUST TRY IT OUT IF YOU LOVE CARD GAMES.Most of you may have played HearthStone before you found this game (if you havent, you should), so i will review this game by comparing ECG to HS. In general ECG is harder to conceive than HS. You have so much more options in each turn and that make you use more time to think. Therefore the game is less fun but more interative than HS. It also not as pay 2 win as HS. In HS it's more likely to be noob and still win with strong deck, but in ECG that element is far less influential. If HS is LoL then ECG is the Dota2 version of it. So try it out !",1
16265,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewReally great mix of Magic and Hearthstone. Tons of different decks and strategies. Cheaper than MtG and more complex than HS. Very rewarding, you can quickly build up you collection.",1
16266,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI played MTGO a lot, years ago when 8ed leagues were still a thing. Been waiting for like - 10 years? Now leagues are back, but it's purely new promoed sets and no casual fun.Enter Eternal!It's all I ever wanted from Magic, only with Stonehearth's nice UX, the same depth, and an actual option of grinding cards AND tix for free. A well executed game from end to end.I'm gonna toss some money on it just to say thanks for the fun, but unlike other TCG's it's all up to me.What a brilliant gem! 10/10.",1
16267,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access Review Enjoyable CCG with some flaws.  Borrows UI, visual design, and quality of life features from Hearthstone while moving the design space forward in satisfying ways.  Card combinations can be very powerful allowing for more interesting deck building options.  Single player options are interesting, but lacking long-term replayability opting instead to drive players to PvP battles. (While this makes sense when considering the genre, there is unmined opportunity that Eternal seems primed to exploit. Upcoming expansions look ready to offer more single player options.) Suffers from resource randomness.The big challenge in Eternal is the very poor system governing resource draw. Resource cards are included and then drawn from your deck (like Magic, Hex, etc.), and there seems to be something wrong with Eternal's deck randomization system. It is common to encounter resource glut, sometimes drawing nothing but resource cards during a single match. While a hand redraw guarantees two resource cards, resource drought is also common. While I understand the wish of the design team to stay true to their Magic roots, the competitive, digital CCG space demands design systems that optimize the player experience. And while Hearthstone's steady resource gain system seems to take some of the life out of the CCG experience, it balances the competitive experience in a critical way. Imagine, for example, if Eternal had a steady resource gain mechanic with a 'random' color draw that could determine the type of the resource drawn. This random draw could still be based on a number of resources included during deck building while helping mitigate the game-breaking randomness of resource draw.While the resource issue is enough to keep me from spending a ton of money on Eternal, I have enjoyed the rest of the game. If you're looking for a game with a strong MtG feel but with a mostly modern design approach to the digital CCG genre, I think Eternal is a good choice.",1
16268,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,Early Access ReviewAs a fan of MTG and Hearthstone this has been a fun game so far. With the campaign mode and full deck building feature your getting a good few hours in before you even know it haha ;D Great game for what it is!,1
16269,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI didn't know a virtual card game company could be so kind that you actually got to keep the cards you drafted!  Imagine playing Arena in Hearthstone except you get to keep the cards you pick! Dire Wolf makes Blizzard look like Satan.  Winning in this game was pretty easy since I have a strong Magic: The Gathering background, and I've ranked very fast in both Draft, Forge, and Ranked.  If you don't like Eternal, it's because you're coming from Hearthstone and don't know how to build a decent deck without Blizzard holding your hand with class limitations. Try using your brain for once (instead of your cash) and get this game!",1
16270,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewMuch more depth than a lot of the other online card gamesout right now. Having the ability to use the whole card pool instead of locked to ""class' really opens up possibilites, you're only really limited by how well your deck and whether or not you can support the resource requirements.There is a ton of single player content to help you get familiar with the game, from puzzles, to a capaign and even it's own draft like format. Rewards aren't bad either, so it may still be worth it if you have already got the handle of the game.I have only two gripes with the game; some cards are just blantantly pushed, overloaded with abilities and stats that other cards just don't have. Some even to the point that in certain game states if you don't deal with the card as soon as it's played you lose. Also the 75 card deck dize have a tendency to really screw over your draws. Both of these issues can lead to some non games where the chance you had to win is astronomically low.  Another thing that's a not huge gripe, but just odd is that the mechanics aren't very well defined, sometimes you have to play a card in a situation to see if it does wht you think it will, I think a lot more clear card text could help.While it does have a crafting system much like Hearthstone it rewards you way more often. Not only do extra cards give you crafting material, every pack you open gives you a decent amount too. Every win gives you a chest that gives you at least a common card and some gold (good for buying everything aside form select cosmetics), with a chance of giving more gold higher rairty cards (never seen anything past rare, with legednary being at the top) or even packs these chests can also be gotten through daily quests, special events and end of month ranked rewards. Every first win of the day gives a pack too. There are cards that can only be earned by playing the campiagn purchasable with real money or in game gold, that may be frutsrating for some players.Card art is ""meh."" Very little of it looks intereasting and it's probabnly because they don't have a ton of space to work with. Premium cards are just a basic filter or some distortion. Brining you own side of the board allows for some unique custoimization, but it's nothing really amazing to look at.All in all I think it's one of the best online CCGs we got out now and I hope they fix some of the issues to make the game really great.",1
16271,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is between good and bad strategy card game.I played this for a little bit and i played HearthStone in the past too so i can say that i enjoyed this game but its a little bit unbalance, some cards are just to op.

16272,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewEternal is a really fun game overall... easy to learn and has a toooon of lore, now despite my ""thumbs up"" review there are a few glaring errors that prevent me from giving this a whole 5 stars...Some people on here complaining about the prologue/tutorial... I honesty blew through it and you can skip cutscenes (shouldn't take too long)Also personally, I enjoy larger decks (TESL allows for 100 cards) I think it adds a lot of depth and randomness to your battlesPROS:- Plays similarly to Magic TG and Hearthstone- Tons of interesting lore with a fun backstory- Cutscenes CAN BE SKIPPED- Fun and enjoyable artwork on the cards- A TON OF GAME MODES- Gauntlet mode is FREE- Larger decks with tooons of card type variety- FREE 30 packs with Twitch PrimeCONS:- Forge mode costs crystals which you can get by winning online PVP or.... you guessed it.... microtransactions (I dont't mind microtransactions but the ONLY way to obtain crystals are through those methods)- PVP servers are close to dead... it takes longer and longer each match to connect with another player and when you do eventually get matched up they give you someone who is well above your tier (I love a challenge but I was up against a 3 Tier Silver as a 3 Tier Bronze)- Additonal campaign modes can ONLY be purchased through crystals and what? Money**PLEASE READ VERY IMPORTANT**If you are to get anything out of this review be advised that there has to be something done about the inconsistent drawing of Sigil cards... they literally will cost you a game.FOR EXAMPLE: In one match EVERY draw for 5 consecutive draws were sigils... my opponent had a loaded field of creatures and I cannot defend or summon without creatures... The reverse is also true, I had one game where I BARELY drew any sigils causing my opponent to have 13 mana and me to have 6.... yes.... 6 I get that there has to be SOME strategy involved but this is just rediculoous. I have upgraded my decks to the maximum capacity and still it seems off to me.How are you supposed to defend/attack with strategy WITH ZERO INFLUENCE?If I have zero cards in my deck and my opponent has 3-4 creatures... guess what? I'll draw 3 conwecutive sigils... it's unfair and you can't really preapre for something that's designed to screw with you.It's flip-flopped every other gameHearthstone, TESL, and MTG have this down to a science (each turn you get mana/magicka/whatever... makes it fair)... follow their lead.That's about it... overall really fun and tons of game modes, however there are some rough patches!!",1
16273,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game has what Hearthstone is missing in complexity without making it a logic problem (Actual strategy variety and lots of room for counterplay), and what it's missing in competitiveness without making it a borefest or a 100% hardcore game  (Fair Variance and no game defining RNG effects). There's still room for polish, but if Hearthstone got your attention, but you felt like it was missing something, give the game a chance.8/10 gg",1

16275,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal is an enjoyable CCG that combines the best card playing elements of Magic: The Gathering with the online automation of Hearthstone. It has just enough differences to be refreshing in its own right. The artwork assets are very good, but not quite up to Blizzard levels. However, most of the artwork, animation and sound is very cool and effective. There are more single player activities than in Hearthstone. The makers of the game supply a generous amount of card packs and coins for playing parts of the game like daily quests, puzzles and tutorials. At the moment, you get a free pre-made deck to keep every 3 days, with a daily quest to accompany it. Multiplayer is standard fare, mostly comparable to Hearthstone. Crafting cards is comparable to Hearthstone also. The game mat is updated with totems on the sides relating mostly to the color of the power sigils used. The micro-transactions are not really necessary if you play the game a lot. Your gameplay activity is synced between your PC/Mac, tablet and smartphone. This is a very fun game that will appeal to online CCG fans.",1
16276,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access Reviewjust for the sakes of it  and to all the new players if you like MTG Arena or MTG in general youll love this game .and for the people hating on rng  stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing and stop playing if you dont want rng in a card game or else it wont even be called a card game  .,1

16278,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is what Hearthstone & Magic The Gathering would be if they had a baby. The tutorial is a bit long, but totally worth it because you get 9 free precreated decks. You can win easily in this game than you can in Hearthstone or Magic TG. It may be early access, but is still fun any how. I haven't noticed ang bugs in this game yet. Some people reviewed that you have to log in every time you play. That is not the case with me. I only have to create a user name and password once and verify my email was mine. Hearthstone I stopped playing because it relied on RNG to win. This game takes skill and patience to create a deck that works for you. Another problem people have with this game is 1/3 of your cards have to be power cards called sigils in this game. They say it's not good for them because they draw sigils when they want a playable card. In this game you have units, spells, attachments & sigels. I got to say this: this game is addicting & I don't mind investing my money in the game when I can afford it. You get 10 cards in a pack of cards with at least 1 of them being a rare or better card. In this game there are common, uncommon, rare, promo, and legenday cards. Gold is easier to make in this game than Hearthstone. And sometimes you get multiple rewards for completing them like gold, individual cards and even card packs, & also dust which you use to create cards you don'r own in yhis game. You can view cardss by rarity, card type, or any combination you want. You can have 4 of the same cards or special sigils (which usely gives you sigils from your deck or 2 different sigils for the price of 1) in your decks unless their specific sigils which take up  1/3 of your deck.  There are 2 currencies in this game gold & Diamonds. Gold you earn by copleting quests or winning a match. Diamonds I think you have to buy with real money, but I am okay with that because I am investing money in a game that I think is better than Hearthstone or Magic TG & I think it aids in the development of the game. I haven't found a limit to the number of decks you can have yet & I have over 30. Some I made & some I bought. And each sigil type has a level up system which I haven't found out what leveling up does. Cards in the game stay the same no matter what level you are, but you gain rewards & achievements for reaching certain levels. There is a lot to this game that keeps it interesting and addicting some of which you can do for free. You can have as many casual or ranked matches you want, you don't stop getting rewards when you reach a certain limits either. I hope this review encourages others to play it too. I hope others enjoy it as much as I do. I can recommend this game to newbies or veterans.",1
16279,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewAmazing game, without a doubt the best F2P CCG that actually doesn't lie when they say is F2P, you can get to the top without spending a dime and building competitive decks in a month or two. The gameplay can be boiled down to say like magic with the aesthic of hearthstone, also the devs take advantage of this being a virtual game by creating cards and effects that would be otherwise hard or impossible to play on reality/physical format. Once you get throught the tutorial and all that jazz go for the free trial twitch prime and claim the eternal package that contains like 34 packs and join the discord, people in there is really helpful and will aid you to get the ropes of the game. So try it out, in the worst case that you dont like how it is played you can uninstall, is free.One note tho; do not buy packs as you try to build your collection, play draft (eternal's equivalent of arena) instead, you open 5 packs, choose cards and by the end of the run you get to keep all the cards you picked!. Even if you are bad at it you can just pick the more rare cards and still get good (and better) value out of it",1
16280,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game mechanics are good and the concept of building your own deck custom tailored to your own play style is promising.Unforunately, once you enter the ranked modus and play a few matches the first thing you realize is, that most of the people just use 9/5 decks that they looked up on eternalwarcry.The second thing you notice is that players with legendary cards simply crush you in every possible way. You already tickled the oppponents health down to around 5 points. Next turn he draws one of his legendary cards and two rounds after that you're finished no matter what you do. I know legendary cards should be really powerful but if you encounter in ranked modus Tier 3 Bronze Players with several legendary cards in their deck it simply feels frustrating. Bottom Line: Have no fun at customizing your deck for lack of cards and the option of simply copying other people's decks. Stillwant to build your deck on your own? Have no fun at getting annihilated by legendary cards.   ",0

The community is great too.Downsides are the very long tutorial you have to go through and the very hard meta in ranked games at the moment. There are a lot of good players with highly tuned decks even at low ranks, wich can be very repellent for starters. I hope they implement a better method of paring players in the future.Nevertheless, its one of the best CCG i've played and surly the best one i've played online!",1
16282,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI have been looking for something like Hearthstone, and I believe I have found it in this game. There have been some comments about not getting the right cards at the beginning, but a redrw usually gets me in the right direction. The artwork is nice, and there is a nice story to follow that, upon completing each battle, you get cards. It seems to be a bit more complicated thatn Hearthstone, but in a good way. You really have to think ahead rather since the opponant can choose to defend or not. Overall, a very nice game which I plan to continue playing for quite a while. Also, although it is indeed completly F2P (and one could play this without spending a dime) there is a nice $2.99 that gets you 3 packs and a load of gems. I find that to be a nice small puchase that supports the game, but doesn't commit a ton of money. Very much worth the 2.99!",1
16283,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI've been playing CCGs longer than some of you have been alive; this is a pretty good one.  Essentially a slightly more technical version of Hearthstone (you can actually do a few things during the opponets turn) that uses the HEX resource system.  The F2P model is pretty generious IMO.  You'll certainly be able to progress, FOR FREE, long enough to know if you want to drop money on the game.  I made my first purchase after about 40hrs of totally free gameplay where I did several Drafts and Forge runs.  Pro tip, don't bother buying packs right away because again the game is very generious at getting you started, so wait until you've exhausted your Rank-Up rewards which give you +3 packs, for a total of +5 packs for beating a Gauntlet.  With 4 tiers that 20 packs of free cards; 15 cards a pack.  Plus there are other ways to get free packs, and Draft/Forge lets you keep the cards you picked, so yeah, its good stuff.",1
16284,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal is what happens if you mixed Hearthstone and Magic the gathering. It is more complex than Hearthstone due to the fact that you can block attacking units with your own, much like in Magic the gathering. Also you don't just get mana every turn automatically but by playing might cards, which are kind of similar to land cards in magic the gathering. So beware becaus you might get landscrewed ;)But don't let that discourage you to try this awesome free CCG. Due to its mechanics it is a hell of a lot deeper than Hearthstone while visually every bit as attractive. There is a whole lot of singleplayer-content in it which provides you with gold and cards. You can earn every card in the game without ever playing against somebody online, that is a huge plus in my opinion. There is a single-player mode called challenge in which you fight one AI opponent after another to unlock rewards. The more opponents you defeat without losing, the greater your rewards. And it is absolutely free and can repeatet as often as you like.Another singleplayer mode is gauntlet in which you draft your deck to play against AI opponents, much like in the challenge mode. The difference here is that you can actually keep your drafted deck afterwards, even if you lose against the first AI. That to me is absolutely fantastic and something that always put me off in Hearthstones Arena mode, where you had to choose between buying a pack or risking your hard earned gold in hope for more than just one pack. That beeing said it costs gold to enter gauntlet mode which is gathered failry quick.If you like(d) Hearthstone or Magic the gathering or any other digital CCG I strongly recommend trying this one. It has a huge collection of cards and has the fairest free to play models I've ever seen in a digital CCG. Great job devs, keep it up!",1
16285,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI was recommended this game by a friend that really enjoys a number of similar games, and I have been loving it every since I first tried it.  There are some cool mechanics that I think can only really be done in electronic card games (or at the very least would be a pain to manage in paper games) and there isn't really any randomness unlike what I have experienced with other games.  Though you can purchase cards with real money, I have never felt the need to as the reward system is extremely generous (you earn a free pack for your first win daily, there are lots of ""objectives"" that will give you a pack or two upon completion, etc).  Lastly, it was quick to learn.  The introductory campaign covered a lot and there is a solid single-player ""puzzles"" section that allows you to understand the ins and outs of different mechanics.Overall, I highly recommend this game!  I enjoy it every time I play, and it was really easy to get into with no starting experience.",1

16287,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewThis is some fine card game. Don't let similar look to Hearthstone fool you. Eternal is much deeper and fun game to play.

16289,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewFirst game review ever. Over 100 hours of this game played and long time TCG player. Eternal is a great game, I like the mechanics and the artwork. It is indeed what HS (and MTG, YGO, online) should be. If you play for a while you get heaps of free packs and cards so you don't necessarily need to spend any money on the game. I stress how good the mechanics and lack of RNG is in this game. Yes, you do sometimes get mana screwed but that is simply part of the game. I would like to see an in-game tournament function",1
16290,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewNo wonder this game is not popular between Twitch streamers.It doesn't matter how great and balanced your decks are.When the system determines you'll get only mana or no mana at all and your opponent will win there's not much to do.Most of your losses will be because of bad hands and not because of a strong opponent.Way to go if you want get frustrated.,0
16291,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI'm hooked! If you like Hearthstone, but wish it had the debth/mechanics of MTG then this is the game for you. Also, the FTP piece os very fair as its pretty easy to earn gold and packs. ",1
16292,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewBasically MTG streamlined to make it more playable on  computer/mobile with some unique mechanics to set it apart. Like in mtg mana screw and flood are a thing but I think some of the people complaining make claims that aren't borne out by statistics or are discounting the positive aspects of that type of not guaranteed mana system like making it possible to have more powerful cards in the high end. That's not to say that they couldn't have more card designs to make it better (more draw or cards that help fix mana in some way) but designers have to take into account positives and negatives when balancing, not just dwell on salient negative outcomes which are often self inflicted e.g. through bad deck building.",1
16293,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI love Card Games and i must say i realy love this one. I have trieed almost every card game on a PC a came along, but none of them keeped me playing like Eternal.Like the other reviewers sayed, its a mix from hearthstone and magic, in a good way.It can be frustrating when you didnt get the power cards (sigils) you need to play cards, bute hey: RNG!But the most important Fact in this Game is the really good PvE Content, you never need to play PvP if you didnt want to and still can progress.Just try it you have nothing to lose :)",1
16294,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis iis one of the best CCG I have played so far. It has a lot of features from Magic the Gathering such as the way units can block and playing ""lands"" but they modified it so that the lands part is not so much RNG how it is in Magic, in this game you get to play units much more often and more action packed games. The turns are fast, but still with a lot of depth, not so much waiting like in Magic. It has the beautiful artwork kind of an edgy comic book style, nice voice work on cards and the story modes. It reminds me of battlechasers the art and sounds. The game is very generous to players, you can earn tons of cards and packjs each day you play all for free. They even just had a nice Twitch prime event where they gave players 33 packs free + avatars and card backs and so on. The story mode is very fun and another way to earn more free cards.When you complete quests the game gives you some free theme decks each week, you can use the cards you get in there to mix with your collection to form new decks as well, so thats another way toget more cards free and fast,There are draft modes, casual play, ranked play, even AI draft style matches and ways to earn cards in Arena style games vs AI and real players.The board looks nice, cards have nice animations and sounds to them, I like how they mixed most of the depth of Magic but made it feel very fast paced and exciting like Hearthstone, but they removed most of the RNG that both of those games have.I rank this game up at the top with Elder Scrolls: Legends and Magic the Gathering Arena, those are my top 3 online card games right now. Eternal is a great and fun game! ",1
16295,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewPros:+ The few back and forth matches that happen from time to time are actually incredibly complex and fun+ Constant stream of packs, generous rewards+ Mana system allows for wide variety of decks+ Similar to Magic the GatheringCons:- Most games go into top deck mode- Mana screw/flood is absolutely infuriating- Legendaries are very expensive- Stubborn playerbase (will elaborate)Here's the official developer's stance on getting mana screwed:https://www.reddit.com/r/EternalCardGame/comments/64ktxt/lets_talk_eternal_im_dwd_game_designer_patrick/dg4qiam/I think this is very misguided. CCGs are fun not because everyone is a serial gambler who wants to coin flip everything away. Variance is fun when it allows every match to be different, with different decisions to be made. Take League of Legends for example, variance and depth both come from champions picks, which you can counter by changing your playstyle. As far as I am concerned, every match where I'm mana screwed is the same. I have no decision to make except watching a slideshow of the opponent interacting with my face.Since the playerbase is comprised of mostly Magic players, anybody who is not satisfied with the mana system is usually discredited and directed to play chess instead, which is very insulting. Also, while the deck-building element is fun and a strong argument for the system, it simply becomes available too late to new players since a diverse collection takes a very long time to build.Another praise I often heard for the game is its complexity and decision-making, which is why I became interested in the first place. Again, this holds true for deck building but during a match, you go into top deck mode pretty often and the game is often decided when one person gets mana flooded.Verdict:Overall, Eternal is a near exact copy of Magic. To me this is a good thing, since the base gameplay is already very fun and unique. However, I cannot recommend this game, since it will also result in some of the most infuriating gaming experiences you will ever face, and the developer's stance on the issue means the situation will never be resolved, and the game will never significantly differentiate itself from Magic.",0
16296,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe power flooding/screwing, how you mulligan, and how inconsistent your decks play ruins what is a competent online CCG. Magic the Gathering is already an exercise in frustration with its 60 card decks. Eternal has 75 card decks -- Why?! This just increases the odds of drawing a streak of cards you can't utilize resulting in many games where you literally lose the game without playing a unit. This, combined with the game's harsh mulliganing where you can only mulligan once to which you have to dump your whole hand, results in a crap shoot that often ends up with these wildly polarizing hands.If you somehow manage to make a game more inconsistent than Magic the Gathering, then you're doing something very wrong. It's really fun when you get a reasonably balanced hand, but too often your options are to draw power for 10 turns in a row or not draw power for 10 turns in a row.",0
16297,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewWriting this review was not easy to me because I really wanted to like this game way much more... I was searching something less p2w feeling than Hearstone and ECG was a good answer to that... Playing ECG is fun and enjoyable, even if you need quite some grinding to reach a decent number of Legendary cards for ladder ranking decks (that everybody use), there are plenty of option for solo or pvp playing and rewarding allows you to increase your collection over time.This game has an issue toh... and a big one. The way it handles mana is quite disturbing: mana flood or mana screw are so easly to happen that you find yourself loosing or winning A LOT of matches just because that happens to you or to your opponent. While there are some mitigation you can put in your deck, this still a point that force you to rely more on your mana luck than in your actual deck composition. After a while this get to a point that the fun with the game fade away.The only deck that does not suffer of this too much is rakano aggro because you can basically play your entire deck with 3 or 4  mana which is easy to get...I bought a 50$ founder pack to suppor developers but this mana issue does not encourage me to invest more on the game nor spending my gems to buy cards that I would not be able to play because of mana issues.Someone suggested to have two separate decks, one with mana cards and one with the rest. That seems a very good option to solve this issue but it looks unlucky they will ever implement this...",0
16298,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewFirst off, I'd like to point out I have spent 40+ hours in this game so far, which isn't much for that genre but is still enough to see what the game has to offer. I usually don't review games in Early Access and try to avoid writing ""pros & cons"" reviews, but in this case I don't see how it can be avoided... So here we go!PROS:* fast-paced like Hearthstone, an average game lasts 5 minutes (maybe 8 if one of you is struggling somehow, it's very rare to draw your whole deck)* free-to-play and quick to unlock (I've unlocked 20 to 40% of each expansion in about 40 hours, and I have enough to buy 8 packs)* puzzles, gauntlet,... basically enough modes to keep you playing if you're not into competitive play, and they count in daily quests to unlock more content* similar to Magic the Gathering in its core mechanics, with lots of synergies availables and pretty silly combos (especially with multicolor decks)!* deck size can go from 75 cards to 150, mana sources included... you can do a lot of silly stuff with that many cards!* an interesting approach to weapons and relics, allowing your character to take part into the fight in different ways, also allowing some synergies to become insanely stronger with the proper combo of items on your hero.* waiting in queue doesn't take too long (usually within 15 seconds), I've never had to wait more than 40 seconds for a game to start (including week days, late hours and such)CONS:* I hated the mana management in MtG, so I hate it here... Most of my complaints about this game are about mana management. I just hope devs would NOT have included mana as cards, because most of the time we are drawing too many of them (or too few), and we just sit there looking at each other until something playable comes up. It's VERY frustrating to lose a game for not being able to play it at all (or win against an opponent with an empty board for 6+ turns), just because you drew nothing of value for many consecutive turns. With only 40 hours in this game, I'm already starting to see a pattern where I'll draw up to 20 mana cards in a row (...yes, 20! I counted!) and lose without having anything to play. The opposite is also true: cards to play but stuck at 2 mana for 10 turns, and my opponent just unleashes a♥♥♥♥♥♥storm in my face. Even the AI in Gauntlet tends to lose for not being able to play anything! There is little to no randomness in this game, but the way mana is managed is just HORRIBLE and breaks gameplay completely... In the end I think it's what will make me leave eventually, I would much rather see the power meter increased each turn rather than having to draw mana sources. I've noticed that issue has been noticed many times before me, any search online will show you countless pages specifically about that.* you are forced to use mana sources in your deck (at least one third!), which basically means you HAVE to include at least 25 cards out of 75 just for mana, without counting alternative sources (units increasing power, units drawing mana, multicolor monuments, etc...). In the end, in any deck you create, you have at least 30-35 cards spent just on mana alone. It's really not easy to optimize your deck building when mana is forced into the deck: in MtG I would usually manage mana with alternative sources, specifically to avoid having to draw lots of terrain and wasting turns on bad draws.* you can't skip most card animations, cutscenes, scripted turns in puzzles, etc... basically leading to a significant amount of time lost to things that won't matter once you've seen them once (especially when retrying a puzzle). In the other hand, some cards you don't know have so much text that you don't have time to read them as your opponent plays them. The history of played cards is not as complete or easy to read as in Hearthstone, which sometimes leads to confusing turns where you're being outplayed and have no clue why or how.* it's using the same system as MtG, units will heal at the end of your turn. If you build a deck accordingly, minions with high health are virtually indestructible and will prevent any damage from the enemy board. Silencing units won't reset their attack/health to the default values, it only applies to specific buffs so you can make some units ridiculously strong and nothing will pass through. I didn't like that core mechanic in MtG and it also applies here, even more so that you can build entire synergies making all units on board gain effects, strength, and/or health almost every turn. There is actually an achievement in the game when you get 999+ HP, and I have taken a couple screenshots in Gauntlet runs where my minions had 970+ attack (individually!) and about the same amount of health... Remember that I have played this game for about 40 hours only, and imagine how broken some synergies must be when you enter the highest levels of competitive play...CONCLUSION:This is a very interesting game with a lot of potential, but because it tries to copy too much on already existing games without fixing their flaws, it ends up being very frustrating (or repetitive once you've managed to build an insane deck) and you feel like there is not much you can do about it. I would recommend playing it for a while just to have a good look at it and have fun while it lasts, but in the end I don't think you will want to spend real money or even keep playing for years. It's sad to say, but because it doesn't fix the issues of MtG and doesn't succeed in entertaining as much as Hearthstone (or Duelyst, Gwent, Shardbound... you name it!), this game is just ""another MtG clone""...",0
16299,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI play a lot of TCGs and I'd definitely recommend Eternal.  It's way smoother to play online than MTG, and way less random than Hearthstone.   And unlike both of those games it's actually possible to gain a real collection without spending a fortune.  I've thrown $20 at Eternal so far, but it by no means feels necessary to get a complete collection.  I think this game is really going to grow as we get more expansions and I'm looking forward to see where it goes.",1
16300,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewFun alternative to the other digital card games available and very friendly to free to play players but sadly deeply affected by a power system that can ruin your fun in an instant. Would only recommend to those who are fine with losing due to power starve/flood. Really hoping to see the game succeed though and will happily change the review during early access.  ,0
16301,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewI played this game enough and it simply boils down to 2 things. You either see passed the mana flood/screwed system or you don't.This is by far one of the best F2P card games in the market. Would I recommend this game? No.Should you make up your own mind and try it out for yourself? Yes.Reasons I stopped playing: 75 card decks are dumb to me. Most games go into top deck mode orheavy mana flood/screw. Only a handful of legendaries are useful. Some game mechanics are extremely a fun breaker and are there to just annoy you. No actual skill needed to play at allin my opinion. Overall nice for maybe a month or 2 but that is it.  ,0
16302,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you're browsing in recent reviews, don't bother with this game. I won't even mention stuff like mana system because some people hate it, some people love it. Rather, it's a prime example of pay 2 win model. Don't trust old reviews saying it isn't. It wasn't always like this, i have to admit. I played it a bit during it's early open beta, it was harsh but a determined player could eventually afford a deck or two in the days when there was only the base set. Now, there's a basic set and 3 other sets with 250-ish cards each. Commons and uncommons are easy to get, but every pack yields only 1 rare(very rarely a legendary). You'll get a few packs at the start, and you'll get a pack from a latest set as a daily reward, but there are LOTS of cards you will need (keep in mind 1k+ card pool), and if you think you'll be able to craft legendaries i have some very bad news for you. Common card dusts for 1 shard, and a legendary costs 3200. And you can have up to four copies of them. New players may think this game is generous, i mean you even get some paltry sum of gold and a common from every bronze chest you open. This flood feels like you make a progress, but the truth is, your progress is equal to the amount of legendaries you own.You may ask, why do you need legendaries? Can't you use commons instead? Well, legendaries have one of two things. They either have a unique game-winning-tier ability no commons have, or they're just a stats powerhouse(or a mix of both). To give you an example, a common 4 cost in yellow has stats of 3\4 and 1 minor skill. The legendary 4 cost is 5\6 + it has 1 minor skill + 1 unique skill no other common has.To sum up, you will never catch up to older players who played every day since early beta or donators. I have to admit the game mechanics and card variety are pretty decent. Too bad all you can do is drool at the crafting screen. If you have a spare 500$ to throw at the game, feel free to try it. If not, then stay away, i hope i will save your time.",0
16303,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewSorta like if Magic + hearthstone had a baby.

16304,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Eternal is a... pretty good game? I guess. But it's also... not a good game? Maybe? And I think my overall opinion of it falls more on the 'not a good game'-side than on the 'yes a good game'-side. I'll try to explain.I enjoy Eternal a lot when I'm building my decks, it scratches that itch in the same way that I used to spend hours constructing decks back when I played Mtg (like... late 90's? So 20 years ago. Jesus.). It's just great figuring out synergies and perfecting strategies, building that engine, and to see -to know!- how everything fits together. So good. And it is genuinely thrilling when you try out your deck and you see the engine work and power the machine that you've built, steamrolling the opposition. (So, turns out, the machine you built was a steamroller.)So so good.And sure, as noted in other reviews, as far as Free-to-play games go, Eternal is pretty generous. I mean, it's a bit grindy, but all-in-all you can earn the currencies needed to support your card-buying addiction.Another thing I enjoy about Eternal is that, because it's fully digital and never meant to be published as a table-top game, they can really play around with the card effects. I have never played Hearthstone, so I don't know how much of a rip-off all of this is, but I do love the fact that cards in your hand or in your deck can get altered for the rest of the match. I really like how the game can make doubles of a card or how it conjures up a card that isn't even in your deck, because it can do all of that because nothing is physical. I guess that might be a small thing to some, but I do enjoy the inventiveness that went into those mechanisms.But. But but but.We have come to the part of why I'm not actually recommending Eternal.You see, the thing is that most of the time, when you're dueling, it feels like you're playing two opponents instead of just the one: There's the person or AI that you're trying to defeat, as you do, and then there's the terrible ""random"" card draw generator. The card draw generator (most colloquially called the RNG around these here parts) is oftentimes completely baffling in how it works. Or doesn't work. It will -quite cheerfully, I'm convinced- more times than should be possible give you the worst hand you can imagine. It will either NOT give you the power cards (so, Mana) that you so desperately need or it will give you -and continue giving you- more power cards than you can ever hope to need (denying you a card that you could otherwise really use right about now).It's pretty bad when you're playing a human (and when my human opponent suffers from it, I feel like my eventual win was not deserved in the slightest) but it's even worse when playing an AI. The AI opponents, of course, never have this problem.So when you build your deck, you've not only got to think about what your opponent might throw at you and try to plan for that, but you also have to plan for when and how the card draw will gimp you. Fun.As an aside, there's probably some confirmation bias and false pattern-recognition going on here, but I've also noticed that the RNG will often give you one type of card in clumps. If you have 2 copies of the same card in your deck of 75 cards, there's a high chance that you'll draw both in a short amount of time. And sure, you usually have multiple copies of cards in the deck so getting a few of the same cards during one game isn't so weird, right? Except it happens a LOT that you just draw the same cards over and over again, so much so that sometimes I forget I had a certain card in my deck until 8, 9, 10 games in I'll suddenly draw it and go: ""Huh, right, there's 4 copies of this card in there, too."" It's especially aggravating when you're literally only drawing weapons or buffs to cast on creatures, but not the creatures themselves.This is just to say that losing because you got shafted in what cards you draw (or don't draw) is the worst. I don't mind losing to a more skilled opponent, but around 90% of my losses is because the card draw generator hates me (and quite cheerfully so, like I said). It's very very frustrating.It's so frustrating, in fact, that for this reason alone, I do not recommend Eternal.(I mean, there's other smaller reasons. The game is technically Pay-to-win and the Meta is pretty annoying, to give two examples. You quickly learn to recognize the decks that everyone is playing and have been copying off each other or the Eternal Warcry site. And it's no fun playing against someone who drops legendary after legendary card because they had either too much money to spend or more patience to grind than you do. All in all, these are more minor quibbles and don't really kill the game for me.)So that's basically why I'm rating the game negatively. Below is small rant that probably no one should read because I get a little bit salty and I realize this review is already too long, so suffice to say that in general these were my thoughts. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.-----RantNow, the Direwolf people might reply to this review with the following (as they have been doing for quite a lot of negative reviews): ""The power system is an important and strategic part of Eternal; if you're having trouble with it, there are lots of tools and techniques that can mitigate this (like adding power-searching cards like Seek Power to your deck, adding more card draw, or finding ways to discard excess Sigils).""This is mostly bull shirt. I would definitely not say there are ""LOTS of tools and techniques that can mitigate this"". Taking a mulligan on your initial draw is useless if the RNG still doesn't give you the power cards that you need (or if it suddenly gives you too many). Seek Power? Oh yes, great card. It's definitely not a waste of a round and a slot in your deck that you could have given to a better card. Pledge? Get out of here. Adding card draw? That seriously depends on which factions you play. I guess Nightfall is pretty cool, but oh wait, that's also only for certain factions.All of this would be moot if drawing power cards was somehow balanced. The game is so inventive and does so many cool things in the digital space, but for some reason they can't program the RNG to give you a power card after not getting one for the 5th, 6th, 7th time in a row when it's clear you're forking struggling to get anything on the board. Or maybe a simple mechanic could be included where you can pass and do nothing that round and get a guaranteed power card next round. Or maybe the amount of power cards you draw in your initial hand could be a fixed amount for everyone. Seriously, it can't be that hard. But no no, ""the power system is an important and strategic part of Eternal."" Sheesh.And the funniest part of it is that in a real-life tabletop card game, the card draw would never cheat you like that, ever. So I don't know, maybe I should go back to playing Mtg in my FLGS? Probably not though.",0

16308,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewFor the first 1,5 months this game used to be incredibly fun. I hit master in ranked and draft after I got the first competetive decks built. The f2p aspect is extremely fair. You conistantly get new cards to improve your library.Some colors have been more dominant than other (Time) because of their incredible wide access to game winning mechanics (carddraw, ramp, undercostesd Legendaries like Sand Storm Titan). But the meta was still fairly diverse and since there weren't as many Sets it is normal for a new card game to not have certain deck types enabled while others will be more reliant. (combo vs midrange for example)So I was expecting the devs to address these issues but they actually managed to do the exact opposite. Time got by far the most playables in the new set. They got improvements in almost all areas. Bigger creatueres, more consistant ramp and the marked allowing for an even more consistant 3 turn threat. It got to the point where the entire meta is basically ONLY TIME decks. Whoever is responsible for the development of the Time faction should get fired. Seriously. What in the world are you guys thinking?It forces people to basically play removal piles and they still can't manage the never ending armada of threats Time plays. There is no thought required to build a ranked deck. Just slap all the Time playables together and hurr durr you will win. No synergy, no concept just get the big OPs as quick on the board as possible. And dw to think about it. The devs did all the thinking for you when they threw all the mechanics on the cards for you. Where other factions have to work to get their synergies working. ( add certain cards to grind through your deck. maybe even a tutor) Time just has it inherent in their cards. Creatures with card draw on power drop, creatures with removal included, creatures with global flyer-lock. Just throw them together and you have this game figured out. I was looking forward to the new expansion but after a week of facing the same exact deck and reviewing the designs I am one hell of a salty customer that is turning away from your product. Too bad I really liked the game up until this point but with as little foresight and understanding of meta balancing that the devs showed with their newest stick I know enough to see where this game is going.

I respect what they attempted to do, and the game is really polished; however, it tries to capture the speed of Hearthstone with the drawing of MTG.  It's awkardly slow-fast. Most of the games end up in top deck situations, and RNG is the only winner of most games.  I really want to love this game, but cannot.",0
16310,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewIt's basically Magic with better UI, somewhat less complex in card texts but interesting card abilities that will keep you entertained quite long. I have been playing this game since closed beta and came back even knowing my progress would be wiped to do dailies. It's just fun. The PvE content is pretty good compared to other card games since it allows infinite rewards from the Gauntlet mode, it's not much (3 Silver chests at maximum wins which equals to about 700 gold + 3 uncommon cards) but you can grind that endlessly if you choose to focus on PvE which is a cool option to have and unique as well.The Draft in PvP is also a lot of fun since you will keep all the cards you pick from the draft making you choose which card you want. When starting out you probably want cards for your collection so sometimes you will pick cards that are bad for your draft but good for your collection. (I picked an off-color legendary just to have it)Overall if you are bored and want a more complex card experience without losing your head in huge wall of text cards like Magic, this is your card game. It's inbetween Magic and Elder Scrolls in terms of complexity and deck building possibility. The f2p model is generous and you will build a collection quickly if you keep playing. I haven't encountered a gold cap per day yet so I suppose it's not there unlike the other card games. ",1
16311,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEven bigger RNG fest than Curvestone because you have 75 cards in decks (with up to 4 copies of the same card), so your draws are VERY inconsistent.More often than not you are left with either excess sigils (i.e. lands from MtG) or creatures/weapons/spells you can't play because you didn't draw sigils to do that.Because of the two reasons above most of the people play aggro decks where many of the cards cost 3 or less. Imagine a game where everyone is playing small creatures and hits face... pretty sad.Another bad thing about this game is that there are no comebacks at all: if one of the players is winning, he's winning by a lot.Granted, the developers are trying to fix this by changing the redraw mechanics (didn't help because you can't redraw a single card, you either keep your whole hand or discard all of the cards) and by introducing weekly quests when you have to win with a predefined deck that is not aggro. But again, the outcome of the matches is so dependent on what you draw, it's not fun even to win as you know your skill has little to do with that. And losing to ideal top decks made by your opponent is even more frustrating than in Curvestone.There were games I couldn't play anything by turn 6 because i got a bad hand, and after redrawing still got only 6+ cost cards and sigils. And playing against aggro decks that means you are dead.On a good side, there's also a mode (similar to HS's arena) where you make a deck from random cards. And this mode is actually much better than ranking because you have only 30 cards in the deck so your draws are much more consistent. And you get to keep all the cards you get in the draft! Alas, this leads to another problem: most of the cards in the draft are common, so you can't possibly explore all the mechanics the game has to offer.***Everything else in the game (art and visuals, sound, single player campaign, card design) is really well done, but inconsistent draws and aggro decks ruin all the fun.P.S. On top of RNG draws, this game has some really counter intuitive interactions. For instance, when you attack and the opponent blocks your creatures with his creatures, you can cast fast spells. So, when you kill one of the blockers with a fast spell (so your blocked creature can attack face), your creature simply doesn't attack at all but becomes exhausted (meaning it also can't block enemy creatures this turn)!Another weird interaction is when the opponent blocks your non-flying creature with his non-flying creature and you give your creature ""fly this turn"" via fast spell, his creature is still able to block your creature even though non-flying creatures can't block flying ones.What's the point of fast spells if you can't surprise your opponent or bait him into blocking/attacking and then ruin his strategy with a spell?",0
16312,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI've played card games for over 15 years and this is the most promising digital CCG I've seen. At a first glance it might look like Hearthstone, but it plays more like Magic the Gathering. Polished user interface and graphics coupled with a great reward system that doesn't require you to spend a cent are rarely seen on the digital card game market. Please do yourself a favor and try out the campaign, it's free after all.",1
16313,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewF2P model CCG which is (currently) generous to the player, providing rewards from constructed and draft style play against scaling AI, as well as versus other human players. This makes the game very accessible to players that are new to the genre and want to learn different deck archetypes, how to build constructed decks, and draft without having to fork out real money to do so, which is quite a frustrating experience in other games. The combat system is more like Magic than Hearthstone, allowing satisfying board interaction by both players.",1
16314,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewStill in Early Access but I havent encountered any bugs with about 35 hours in so far. Eternal is very free-to-play friendly and it clearly draws alot of its economic model from Hearthstone. It is less simplistic and more reminiscent of Magic: The Gathering in terms of gameplay but keeps some of the more complex mechanics out which is great for players just looking to jump into the game.I recommend this to fans of the CCG model who seek something different from Heathstone and also want to avoid the low production value of many of the recent CCGs that I have found.,1

16320,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal sits in between Magic The Gathering and Hearthstone. It could use some polishing, but I'm sure the team is on it. This game can be huge if the devs keep improving it. I highly recommend it.",1
16321,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewLike many others I grew up as a typical teenage Magic nerd and naturally I am interested in any digital version that could capture me the same way. Other than the timeless and amazing Shandalar, I have yet too find a really decent and accessible digital competitor, until now!Eternal is far from archaic and has happily and correctly snapped up all the best things about Hearthstone, while also integrating the best of the more advanced mechanics from Magic the Gathering. Pros:+ Clear and inviting interface. Smooth graphics and decent art for an indy title. Performance is very good and I have yet to encounter any disconnects or crashes. The cards and their actions are all very nicely and satisfyingly animated. It is very reminiscent of Heartstone in this regard. Lots of attention to details, like high power creatures having an extra 'oomph' when they do damage+ The card-playing mechanics are significantly improved and much more in-depth than Hearthstone. One of the key factors here is the way blocking works. Just like Magic, you can't just attack whatever creature you want. Rather you declare your attackers and the opponent can then choose to block them (or not) and assign his blockers as seems best. This is a fundamental change from HS and it makes the game feel much more strategic. You also have interaction with the graveyard, interrupt spells, artifacts, attachments (enchantments) and plenty of dimensions you can build your decks around, including new ones not seen in classic MtG or HS.+ Similarly, the game uses a mix between hearthstone and Magic when it comes to mana. You need to budget for mana cards and there are many variants of them. This adds an extra dimension to deck-building as many creatures and spells directly interact with them. It can result in some dead hands although this is very rare (the game secretly ensure you get two power cards should you decide to mulligan)+ Despite offering more depth, the game is far more accessible and generous than HS. The devs have correctly understood that for a game like this to gain traction when HS is so dominant on the scene, you need to let players get a lof of cards quickly so you can open up the choices. Almost anything you can do in the game results in a constant flow of cards, be it Ranked, Gauntlet, Forge or Draft. You also get lots of crafting dust so you can get those key cards to make your deck work and there are plenty of quest rewards and themed decks coming your way.+ The four game types mentioned above are likewise very well designed. Ranked is your standard ladder. Forge is very similar to Arena in HS. You pick from three options at a time until you have 25 cards, then you play against a gauntlet of AIs, each win upping your reward. Draft is a direct derivative of Magic's drafting format. You and other players take turns picking cards from 4 random booster packs, and then you craft a 45-card deck. You then have a gauntlet of 7 real players to beat. Did I mention that in both forge and draft you get to keep ALL cards?+ Balance is on-point to the extent that it can be for the moment. So far I haven't seen any outrageous or unfair cards that cannot be countered. Some deck types will lose to others more often than not, but that's just card games for you. There is of course a meta and I'm sure the deck types narrow as you go further up the ranks.Cons:- I honestly don't have any serious complaints to mention. The game is still early access but it certainly feels like a full game. The casual mode is not yet active, and that is a bit annoying. When you try out new decks, Gauntled mode against the AI won't really give you a good benchmark and you are going to be hesitant to take it straight to ranked. Luckily you can still play against your friends as much as you like, as if it were casual. - I would like to see a tournament mode added into the game as well. It would be a lot of fun to participate in elimination-style competitions against other players and of course your friends on a daily basis, with rewards for finishing in the top 2 or 3. Larger seasonal tournaments would be really cool as well. EDIT:- One serious issue with the game currently is the mandatory campaign tutorial. You have to play 4 games for each color, for a total of 21 games, one of which can take a good few tries. You are limited to really poor starter decks that are very boring to play. This can really turn off a lot of players and it takes a good 2-3 hours to get through. If I hadn't already known this going in, I might not have continued playing and that would have been a great shame. I really hope the devs revisit and shortens this soon. 5 mandatory games would've been plenty. Gauntlet mode is already a great way to learn the game.In summary: a great free-to-play title with a complete lack of paywalls or pay-to-win mechanics. It combines the best of Magic and HS into a brilliant mix and you will get addicted.",1
16322,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,Early Access ReviewEternal is a great fast paced card game with really good and well thought out game design. I recommend it to anyone looking for a card game thats not Hearthstone or a card game with a much faster pace then MTG.,1
16323,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,Early Access ReviewProbably the best CCG out there at the moment. If you like Magic but in a bit faster paced environment with deep deckbuilding this is the game for you. If you are annoyed by Hearthstone constant RNG effects and One-Deck-Meta this is the game for you. Give it a try and before you realize it hours will have gone by and you need to be off to work or school without realizing it. Definite recommendation!,1
16324,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewA very enjoyable alternative to hearthstone (coming from an open beta legend player) with devs that are comitted to keeping the game up to date.

16325,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewA suprisingly fun and decent card game, even if it's visual design feels like it's aping Hearthstone a bit too closely. After actually giving it some time I've found it to be a good game in it's own right, I especially enjoy the two-tier mana system, where you require both a ""You must be this tall"" influence cost and a flat mana cost.Definitly worth checking out if you like these types of games, try not to be put off by the tuturial over-staying it's welcome a bit, as well as getting trounced in it, the starter decks are actually really bad, but as soon as you throw together even a haphazard one of your own it's much better.",1

16330,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal is a game unlike any other before, combining elements from the classical trading card game Magic: The Gathering, as well as some elements from the rapidly popular Hearthstone, Eternal is a wonderful fusion of classic TCG gameplay brought into the new digital age. Unlike HS, Eternal generally leans away from RNG elements, prefering to use the online platform to implement mechanics that would be impossible to track in a paper card game. Eternal stays true to the formulaic gameplay of MtG, having five colours of resource, and needing to have colored resource cards in your deck, as well as limiting cards based on said resource. All in all, if you enjoyed any TCG or OCG, Eternal is a wonderful unique experience and it absolutel is one for you!",1
16331,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewMtG + Hearthstone = this game, though it is far better than all the soulless Hearthstone clones.Very fair f2p policy, though given how good the legendaries are there's some pay to win in the system.",1
16332,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewSimilar to MTG in terms of deck creation, but with mechanics that are a little simpler and take advantage of being digital. Has the visual style of Hearthstone with a bit of the MTG flavor of fantasy and color themes.The F2P aspect of the game is very generous as far as these things go. Budget decks are reasonably competitive within the meta and there's a variety of archetypes that are relatively even at the moment. I'd say the star of the show is their Draft game mode. It is essentially what most veteran MTG players know Drafting as. For anyone who doesn't know, it's similar to Hearthstone Arena, but you keep the cards you put into your deck. The rewards for Draft are also very generous (beyond even just keeping the deck you make).The only significant warning/con for people looking into the game is this: The Campaign is a slog. If you're going to try the game, please promise me and yourself that you'll get through the Campaign and not judge the game by it. It's awful. The story is fine, but it takes way too long and the decks they give you are rough.",1
16333,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,Early Access ReviewA TCG where you don't feel like to have to sell yourself on the streets for to earn cards for.

This first set has been fun and there are lots of different decks you can build. I'm enjoying the grind to get more cards at this time. I can't wait to have a great ranked deck though.",1
16337,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewLike some had said, it's a very good card game. A good mix magic the gathering (tactics and complexity) and hearthstone syle (digital, animations). Tutorial is simple, so you need to learn some interactions and new names to different affects (some you find in magic some in hearthstone) when you play solos to unlock different decks. Monsters/minions aren't that interactive yet like in hearthstone (sonds and intros that give charather to them). I personaly didn't had problems adjusting cause of my experience playing Magic, Hearth, Shadowverse and so on, but none kept my interest so i hope this one will.",1
16338,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is a digital card game with the depth of Magic and the polish of Hearthstone. Direwolf has hired on some of Magic's best pros to help out with the card design and it really shows.This game uses MTG attacking and blocking, meaning it is easier to get a stalled board than Hearthstone, but so far I've not had too many issues with it because there are lots of way to break stalls with combat tricks and other cards. You can play instants in this game, though they are called Fast Spells, and can only be played in response to a card being used on your units, during combat, and at the end of turn. This is actually very nice because it means you aren't f2ing through your opponent's turn. There are a few RNG cards, though nothing nearly obscene as in Hearthstone.This game has you put your mana, which is called power in this game, in your deck, like in Magic. However colors are done through Influence. Once you get 1 of an influence of color, you can play any card that only has that influence requirement. So you don't have to worry about using the right color power. For players coming from Hearthstone, the power system can be a sore point because you will come across times where you either draw too much power, or not enough power. You get a free Mulligan each game. When you take a Mulligan, you are stuck with what hand you draw. However after you mulligan, you are guaranteed to get at least two power in your hand. The free-to-play model is very generous. It follows the same pattern of Hearthstone, but since each pack contains 12 cards, rather than 5, it makes it easier to get all the common and uncommon cards. Also, drafting and forge let you keep the cards you choose, which let you build up your collection that way.All-in-all, I would say this is an excellent game and highly recommend that anyone try it.",1
16339,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI've been playing since the closed beta, and this game has been a blast. Currently, there are four different game modes available. Ranked is where you play against other players with a preconstructed deck on a ladder. The matchmaking generally works pretty well, the only issues I've run into is with some long wait times, which a larger pool of players should alleviate. Draft is like Ranked, except you begin by drafting 48 cards from 4 packs and building your deck from that pool. This is a fun game type that also helps build your collection, since you get to keep any cards you draft. There are also two AI modes. Gauntlet lets you put a preconstructed deck up against the AI to earn rewards, and helps you build a draft style deck by giving you three cards to choose from at a time to go in your deck. This is another good way to build your collection.As far as gameplay goes, I've really enjoyed it. My background is in Magic : The Gathering, and this game sits in a similar place in terms of strategy. You can interact with your opponent on their turn, and combat gives the defender their choice of blocking and how. At the same time, the complexity isn't extreme, and the turn structure flows pretty smoothly once you get the hang of it. I am hoping that DWD will put out a comprehensive rules at some point, since there are a few interactions that aren't immediately obvious and seem to be inconsistent, but those are rare.One of the best things about this game is the community it has. Some names you might recognize if you're involved in the TCG/CCG community are Luis Scott-Vargas, Brian Kibler and Patrick Chapin. They're not always on, but it's not unusual to run into them in a draft or ranked match. There's also finkel, but he's not the real Finkel, even though he's great. You can see the touch of these players in the meta, which feels fairly balanced. It's a little aggro heavy right now, but that is already shifting as people start rebuilding their collections. They've also tweaked the meta outside of a full set release by giving out Promos, cards that can be earned by winning your first game of the day, or crafted if you don't feel like competing for it.Overall, I'd give this game a 9/10, it's a great game if you enjoy the genre and I strongly encourage you take a look.",1
16340,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access Review I encourage everyone that is tired of Hearthstone developer/balance/RNG nonsense to try this gem. It may lack HS's flashiness (just a bit tho), but man it is  deeper 100x times .Tons of keywords including double attack, deadly, lifegain on hit, something happening once unit connects to face, spell protection and much more, also there is a void (where your dead or discarded cards go) and you can actually interact with it by either drawing or playing cards directly from the void if that is what your deck is about.There are no understated 'Taunts' as ANY unit can block another one each turn, and you should actually think when to attack and when to hold, and also which unit to block to gain more advantage. There is no straight minion trading and the system favors the defender/blocker more, generally: if your unit attacked, it can't block on the next opponent's turn (unless it has special keyword), and multiple minions can block the same attacker, resulting in more favorable trade for defender. Want to attack? Think about it. And then think how exactly to attack, leading to...Spells you can cast on your opponent's turn, that leads to more interactiveness. Imagine you could kill annoying charge or whatever minion on your opponent's turn (if you saved mana(power) for the spell on your previous turn ofc). You can bait your foe to make unfavorable trades which he doesn't expect, counter spells of Your choosing etc.As for the F2P side,  THIS GAME IS SO GENEROUS IT'S UNBELIEVABLE after playing 3 years of HS. There is single player mode where you can grind both gold and cards with just cards you get from tutorial campaign (and you build up your collection steadily and quite fast I must say). I've been playing Eternal for like 60 hours now and I have almost all commons and uncommons, most rares (epics) and 18 legendaries (you can put up to four same ones in a deck), I payed in cash for just 3 packs, everything else you get just for playing the game, and the better you play, the more you get. So in 60 hours I opened over 70 packs from which only 3 were for cash. Also you get crafting 'dust' just for opening the pack, and you can still dust your extras if needed.There are both Solo and Versus 'arenas', and you  KEEP THE CARDS YOU DRAFT! And you can draft golden cards of any rarity too! This alone is almost worth the gold you pay, and if you win a few games, it gets even better. You get bronze, silver, gold and diamond chests for completing game activities and quests. These contain single cards (1 common in bronze, uncommon in silver, rare in gold and random golden card in diamond) plus gold (up to 2 packs worth of gold in 1 chest), and Golden+Diamond chests yield card packs. Also there is a chance that your chest upgrades on opening (bronze can go up to diamond!), this chance is about 10-15%.Card packs contain  12  cards, including 1 rare/legendary and I believe 2 or 3 uncommons. You get 1 bronze chest for every ranked win, and every third chest is silver (these all can upgrade too!) Low RNG element and more overall control of what you do, for example you  choose which minion to resurrect from your void, what card you force your opponent to discard (yes that's a thing). The only thing you don't control is drawing right cards, which can be frustrating since you need to build up your 'mana' through cards which take 1/3 of your decks. If you starve on power early on, you can't play your cards, if you are topdecking power cards when you desperately need something else, they are literally dead draws. And that can happen many times in a row, so I guess mild bad luck protection would be sweet. Playstyle variety. Man, there is a  lot  to play with: you can buff your top units of your decks into a huge monsters and overwhelm your opponent, you can go for removal/lifegain strategy, you can play with resurrecting dead/discarded cards etc etc, and since there are tons of keywords and actually a great amount of cards in vanilla set (over 400), the combo potential is HUGE, and yes, these decks are viable, in fact, most of the powerful decks are built on sinergy and not on OP 1 card bombs (yet there are surely some of these cards present, but not to an extreme degree and devs are balancing stuff atm in the beta at least)Visual effects and art style are decent. Don't expect Blizzard level, but if you put HS art and animations at say 10/10 this would be 8.5 or maybe even 9 if they tweak some golden card animations, but they are not bad at all, just could be improved somewhere.Overall I'm quite impressed, it feels like Eternal took the best parts of other TCGs and blended it all in one place. This is a game many players wanted Heathstone to be mechanic-wise and MTGO user/visually wise. It's complex, actually strategic, skill rewarding and extremely generous with F2P rewards: just play the game and get tons of stuff!Will definitely stay and play it for a long time,9.5/10 ",1
16341,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI'm sure by now you've read other reviews. Most say this is a combination of Magic The Gathering and Hearthstone. Don't be fooled .... It REALLY is. They combine almost every detail from both games. At first, when I read reviews, I thought it sounded like a rip off, but from 2 games. It really isn't. It's different art, different gameplay, but it has the same key features from both games. Maybe that's why I like it so much. I've played both games, this combines what is missing from both games. And it isn't popular enough yet where ranked matches get really competitive. Obviously they are still working on it. You may come across a card or 2 that seems over powered, but It's still loads of fun crafting a deck. It is also fairly easy to get gold for the draft, but again that makes it less competitive (Which is a plus when a game like hearthstone has Major strategists that won't let you catch a break) Overall, a great game to at the very least try for a day or two.",1

I played Magic the Gathering for 14 years before the Vintage / Legacy player scene in my city got too toxic for me to tolerate - sold all my cards and cashed out.  I tried Hearthstone but like many attest, it's too dumbed-down for me.  It feels like checkers and I want to play chess. So then someone turned me onto Eternal.  I haven't played a game of Magic in 3 years and I've now spent almost 6 straight hours playing this -- I'm hooked!  It's got the feel of Magic's rich strategy and synergy-heavy card types, with the admittedly gorgeous artwork and sound design and intuitive interface of Hearthstone.  It's also very easy to get new cards - no pay to win, here.  I've already gotten 6 free decks and 6 free boosters just for playing the quests and ranked games, and enough in-game gold to buy 5 more boosters if I want.I think this is going to be the next big thing.

I'll keep it short and sweet; I've played 5 different card games since childhood and have played them all hardcore; this game IS what magic online should've been. It plays exactly like magic, with a polished, contemporary Hearthstone-esque look and vibe. A TON of deck variety and way, way more meta than hearthstone or magic. Definitely give this game a try. The ONLY negative for me is the tutorial; way too long and they don't explain everything completely, such as differences in weapon types etc. Grind through the tutorial though, it's definitely worth it.",1
16349,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewOkay guys, I have played this game for 3.9 hours at the time of writing this review. I've been looking for a card game with some story and have yet to find any. I play Magic and it had some which I enjoyed. The graphics on this game are very nice. The card system as far as mechanics are good as well. If you are looking for story, this game doesn't have any. To me this is just another card game that doesn't add anything new. There is a way to craft cards in this game similar to others and you can expect them to cost a rediculous amount. Overall if you're trying to find a nice card game to play I'd give this one a try bearing in mind you don't care about story.",1
16350,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access Review+Generous in terms of card acquisition.+Marvelous deckbuilding in terms of design and creativity: it can allow broken combos and you need a lot of expensive cards sometimes, but quite cool. (In the game you can have up to 4 copies of each card per deck, still I said it's really free-to-play).-Automacic mulligan. You can keep it, or draw a full new hand, a little frustrating and ""not in your hands"".-Resource mechanic (sigils, a.k.a. as mana, lands, etc in other games) is kinda broken, Magic style, not horrible, but somehow annoying. You can have 8 resource cards and nothing to play or the opposite easily.It's early access but it's a desing flaw they should fix.The only signigicant flaw I can notice is the same as before, where building a deck is certainly a very fun and interesing experience, playing it's not a lot more than clicking avaiable cards for your turn and keeping a couple of reactive spells in hand.I learned quite a bit about deep mechanics and the game has a lot, a lot of super powerful combos, wich makes even bigger the feeling of only one person destroying the other, either you or your opponent. This makes the resource system somehow not that big of a problem, but still frustrating sometimes.Still, it's worth a try in my opinion, but keep in mind deckbuilding is very deep and fun, and actualy playing is as hard as saying the alphabet. It has a ""Gaunlet"" mode wich is like a ""Versus IA arena"" you can enter for free and earn some cards and gold so, I would recommend trying it a little bit.",1
16351,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewExactly what you want out of a digital card game. Eternal has fewer ""wacky RNG"" design choices than Hearthstone and a much better business model. The tutorial and especially the puzzles are also surprisingly fun and well-crafted. 10/10 would play again",1

16353,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIt's a fun and fair trading card game. It take influences from games like Magic The Gathering and Hearthstone but totally feels like it's own experience. I like the art a lot, it feels like a cartoon. I also enjoy the multi-color cards and the depth they create.Update Feb 2018:Game is still good.",1
16354,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewA great card Game!The visuals are nice and it mixes really well Hearthstone and Magic indeed.The number of card is already consequent and there are many game mechanics that can be mixed.

16355,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI really like CCG's and have played a lot of Magic the Gathering back in the day. Also much HearthStone and a little Shadowverse. Eternal is imho the best F2P CCG out there. Two things really shine here. The generous reward system with upgradable chests and the Draft system where you get to keep all your picks.Game modes vs AI Campaign: Introduces you to the game and mechanics. Also gets you some cards. Gauntlet: Choose your own deck and play vs the AI and earn better rewards. Forge: Build a deck of 25 cards by picking from 3 cards each time. Play vs the AI and earn better rewards.Game modes multiplayer Events: Special periodic events with prizes and leaderboard. Build an 'x' themed deck and play vs others. Casual: Choose your own deck and play vs humans. Ranked: Choose your own deck and play vs humans. Laddering system (bronze, silver, gold, diamond and master) Draft: Build a deck of 45 cards by opening 4 packs and picking 1 card then passing the pack. You get to keep all your picks.Daily QuestsThere are also quests which will give you rewards like 2 silver chests or 1 gold chest upon completion. Like ""Win 2 vs Games in a row"" or ""Play 10 Flying units"".Rewards systemThe reward system comes in the form of chests. Bronze, Silver, Gold and Diamond chests. One of the best things about this game is that when opening a chest you have a 10% chance to get a better chest. That first time opening a silver chest that gets upgraded to a Gold chest is FeelsGoodMan. Getting a single chest upgraded multiple times is also possible. Bronze > Silver > Gold > Diamond chest. Only about 1/1000 :)Questing, gauntlet, forge, win a casual, win a ranked and drafting all get you them nice chests :)",1
16356,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewCan offer great fun at 0 cost. If you play the game for the dailies and in between other activities/games, you can be competitive and/or have fun.Has a short single player campaign that works more as a tutorial. From holding your hand on the first steps, to chasing after you with a M9A1-7 flamethrower. Campaign includes rewards. From single random cards to entire starter decks.Aside from the campaign, single player offers a puzzle mode, for mediocre rewards. The main focus of the puzzles is entertainment. However, a lot of the puzzles offer insights on obscure mechanics that otherwise would take a lot of experimenting to figure out.The Gauntlet mode (also under single player) is what the name implies: go through all the bouts with an increasingly difficult AI to recieve Gold (the F2P currency) and cards/card packs. It is free to participate in, which is reasonable, given the rage it induces with BS AI. At higher tiers, for people that are there for just the Gold, it is very punishing, as a singl defeat takes you out and not until the fifth out of seven victories will you start seeing any worthwhile rewards.The Forge mode is a cheaper draft mode, against the AI. As it is cheaper, the rewards are also inferior. Accessible to new players and good to fetch faction specific colors. Win or lose, you get to keep the picked cards. Forge mode forces you to use a 2 color deck, so you can limit what you get with the first few picks. If you win all your fights, you should get enough Gold to participate again (even a bit of profit)Under the PvP flag, you have the Casual and Ranked game types, which are common in most games these days. There is a season reward for Ranked and Draft (more on this game type below). Casual and Ranked are free to compete in.There is also an Event mode under the PvP section, which varies. I do not recommend participating unless you have a good collection. Otherwise you'll just be feeding other people, getting reward packs at regular value and wasting precious currency that could be better spent under Forge orDraft. A very generous draft system. You pick 48 cards out of 4 packs, paying a bit extra for this opportunity (20%). Victory or loss will get you the 48 cards, but do try your best as rewards aren't shabby at all, and if you score nice on the rank ladder you get even more rewards (even being bad, if you participate in 5 Draft sets, you will get at the very least an extra pack at the end of the season).Topping this off, you have daily (doable) quests that can be exchanged once per day for a different quest. Also, you have periodic theme quests (3 days, I think?) where you get a free theme deck and are asked to win 5 times with a deck with those colours (not necessarily the one offered).It is a very good game. Do yourself a favour and go through the basic campaign and play 2/3 matches in each game mode before you come to a decision.",1
16357,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe art style is not really my favorite, but the game has a good base and enjoyable gameplay very much like Magic the Gathering mixed with Hearthstone.  My biggest complaint would be the lack of ramp cards and the fact you cannot have less than 1/3 power cards in your decks.Overrall super fun, hope it gains popularity.",1
16358,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you like MtG i highly recomend Eternal (simlar play style). Many more important decisions than heartstone.I love that the developors balance the game (Nerf AND Buff) on a regular basis to keep the metta fresh. Also, increadably Free To Play.",1
16359,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you like TCG this is a great game.If you like games with real action, then you will probably give up on this after the first 2 hours of playng like i did.Still a good game tough.",1
16360,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewSo, imagine a game of hearthstone.your board is looking sweet, covered in all sorts of 7/7s and clones of them, you're going to kill your opponent next turn, you've got this if they don't have a boardwipe.WHEN SUDDENLY a wild Yogg appears and all your minions are victim to it's hapless RNG based clearing bullocks. so you casually kill the Yogg in your opponents turn and swing in for lethal.Because this isn't hearthstone. this is Eternal, and we can react to our opponent's torture. wildly recommended",1
16361,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal is an incredible card game all around.Similar to Magc: the Gathering in many ways, Eternal streamlines the formula and adds its own twists to make a game that plays faster, more balanced, and with deep strategic interplay both over the course of individual games and in deckbuilding.Eternal rewards skill and strategy, and thanks to its generous free-to-play system skill really does matter (easily the most generous of any card game on the market - this game is actually free to play, even at competitive levels).For existing card game fans, this is a masterfully designed game that takes existing concepts and improves them while adding its own spin. For those looking to get into card games for the first time, Eternal is also a great place to start, as its generous card structure and deck building methods reward experimentation and clever play, while also allowing you to learn as you go.",1
16362,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal is an excellent, F2P-friendly digitial card game with engaging gameplay, deeply flexible deck-building mechanics, and a diversity of game modes (PvE and PvP versions of both draft and constructed play). I can't recommend it enough if your a fan of CCGs, and doubly so if you're looking for a more strategic alternative to games like Hearthstone.My background: I played Hearthstone ferociously for about six months before growing tired of its stale metas. I moved onto Duelyst and found I enjoyed the more complex, board-based gameplay, but recent expansions have promoted flashy, swingy games with increasing amounts of RNG. I also tried other popular alternative CCGs such as Shadowverse and Elder Scrolls: Legends. Neither hooked me.Eternal drew me in with its diverse set of game modes. Feel like grinding? Gauntlet lets you play constructed decks versus the AI for decent, continuous rewards. Ladder shows greater diversity than games like Hearthstone, owing in part to the large deck sizes which allow for common archetypes to exist in a variety of forms and combinations. Draft is excellent, featuring its own ladder with end of the month rewards. It's an awesome way to build your collection, as you get to keep the cards you draft. This allows for a wonderfully direct way to customize your collection, especially as you're starting out.While the diversity of game modes is what drew me in, the rich gameplay is what has really hooked me. Mechanics such as Echo (when an Echo card is drawn it automatically creates a copy of itself that also goes in hand), Relic Weapons (hero weapons whose live totals can be modified through a variety of means providing you with extra attacking and removal options that can last a long time if used strategically), defender-prescribed blocking, and Fast Spells (spells that can be played in response to an opponent's actions including on their turn) make for some deep, strategic, and interactive gameplay that is much more rewarding than the back-and-forth nature of Hearthstone. The card-based power mechanics (reminiscent of Magic's Lands) makes deck building very flexible and multi-faceted. Three-faction decks are common and strike a nice balance between the power of having more options and the increased challenge necessary to pilot such a deck. At the same time mono-faction decks are quite valiable, with two faction decks perhaps the most common and presently supported. Deck construction can be as streamlined or multifaceted as you desire.Eternal's meta is regularly in flux owing to consistent tuning by the developers (who show more willingness and tact to nerf or buff than Hearthstone's Team 5), but is generally much more friendly to slower decks than the other aforementioned CCGs I've played.The game is intensely F2P friendly. In addition to the ability to keep the cards you draft in draft modes, each win in constructed nets you a chest which awards both gold and cards (the rarity of which increases as the chest rarity rises). Packs provide twelve cards: 8 common, 3 uncommon (equivalent to a rare in Hearthstone or Duelyst), and 1 rare (""epic"") or legendary. Gold-level chests award packs, and Draft and Forge (draft versus the AI) also award chests at a run's completion. All this is to say, regularly play is very well rewarded and allows for the amassing of an extensive collection. I've enjoyed Eternal tremendously for its rich gameplay. It's hard to believe the game is still in Beta. Future features like in-client tournament modes and best out of 3 play will only further round out this already stellar game. If you're a fan of card games, especially deeper ones, I can't recommend Eternal strongly enough.",1
16363,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewGreat mechanics, great game. It is pretty rough getting legendaries, especially since you can have 4 of each, but there are many reward systems and game modes that let you feel progress. It is a little unsatisfying when a player whips 3 of the same powerful legendary on you in a game, but if you made your deck well and get some good draws you can sometimes still win in those situations. I like it.",1
16364,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is excellent. Well-polished software, well-balanced cards, great F2P system, and addicting rewards that keep me coming back every day.While this game may look like Hearthstone in screenshots, the fundamental mechanics are much closer to Magic. There are 5 factions you can mix and match when building a deck (lots of variety!), the resource cards are similar to lands (although its version of the mana system has been streamlined a bit, making this a much less clunky digital card game than digital versions of Magic itself), and combat is quite similar to Magic in that the attacker simply attacks the other player and the defending player chooses how to block.The constructed meta is quite fun and balanced at the moment, and DWD fights hard to keep it that way. And with the rewards being as generous as they are, you can have a tier 1 deck after only a few weeks of playing, with $0 spent.Drafting is super fun and rewards are very generous (including keeping what you draft!); I haven't spent any money on draft and I draft almost daily. Also your packs are passed to you by real players, so you can read signals just like a real life draft. And yet there's no waiting and you can take as long as you like to make picks. It's ingenious how they designed this system.Please, if you're at all a CCG fan or looking to try them out, give Eternal a download!",1
16365,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewSo far I'm enjoying this more than *Curvestone*+Lots of Players, Match is up after a waiting time between 1 and 12 Seconds+Solid Cardbase+Fair Grind (went Gold-League after 30 hours)+Single Player Modes alone make it worth a try+polished UI/Graphics/Sounddesign+ drawing cards for mana actually can be fun and rewarding with the right strategy- drawing  cards for mana actually suxx heavily even with the right strategy= 7.9/10 Still Early Access, so be patient... ",1
16366,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal is an amazing card game. Gets rid of everything that bogs down Magic and Hearthstone, and is free to play - bonus! Only issue I have is the obscene cost of gems - the money to amount ratio given the amount of gems you need to do various things is horrendous. For $3.99 I can get 200 gems, which will buy me a pack that I could most likely get for FREE via coins going through gauntlets. I understand it's a free to play, but if people (like me) are willing to spend money on a game you should at least make sure that your bottom amount can obtain something. The card crafting is awesome as well, but again, the cost to create/destroy is a bit out of whack - maybe half the create cost when you destroy a card?I don't know who to contact about this, but I would love to be in on future gameplay design. I've played Magic since 1997 (roughly Ice Age release) and have played in local and state tournaments. I've run gaming groups/clubs at colleges, and been a member of local groups in my town. Have even been researching owning my own card shop/game center. Please contact @ lazaren5632@gmail.com for the above? Thank you and keep up the awesome work.",1
16367,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI started playing Magic the Gathering back in middle school and continued through highschool.  Unfortunately once I graduated and my group of friends moved on, I gave up the game.  Our group was never competative (I'm sure most of us never realized that Magic tournaments existed), we just played the game to have fun.I learned that Magic Online was a thing that existed shortly after it released, but learning of the pricing scheme there was no way I was going to get involved with it (and this is coming from someone that was willing to pay a monthly subscription to MMO's).  It just seemed rediculous to me to pay for digital cards...when they weren't actually collectables in my mind.  PC gaming was always my main hobby even during my Magic years, and quite frankly there are TONS of PC games better than what Magic offers.Fast forward to today and Eternal.The game has everything that Magic should offer to a player.  It has an excellent Deck building system that lets you quickly and easily sort your collection even as new cards are added.  It has a variety of game modes, including both Competative and non-competative options which is very important for me as I need to be in the right mood to want to play vs. another player.  It has great characters and an interesting setting that stands out from other games.  But the most important thing Eternal has is fun.The game is FUN.I really appreciate how the developer (DWD) has taken the time to realize that they aren't creating just a card game.  They are making a Computer game.  They have taken the solid foundation that Magic has built and turned that into a game that is actually modernized for play in the Internet Era.Each game takes ~5-7minutes usually and with how they have structured their game modes and rewards, you still feel like you are making progress towards earning new cards even if that one game is all you have time for.  If you are playing one of the modes versus an AI opponent, you can even leave mid-game and come back later if required.The most recent (Aug 2017) feature added was an excellent puzzle mode, which to me harkens back to Scrye or Inquest ""what's the play"" puzzles.  Even though I have been playing the game for about a year I was surprised how many ""tips for new players"" they were able to add into the puzzle mode to give you a little bit of a strategic level up after coming out of the tutorial.  I am so happy I found this game and honestly very excited for its future.  An account long-term progression mode is coming soon and I am interested to see what that offers.",1
16368,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewBest digital TCG out there. It really is free to play if you are willing to spend the time playing it, i'm playing for a few months now and it really never gets boring to play. Definitly rewards players for their in game decisions and deck building, not the random nonsense from Heartstone.Yes, itÂ´s like playing a simplistic but also faster version of MTG. The meta is very diverse and there isn't any faction that is stronger than the others. If you are tyred of HS then this game is for you, but with a warning: it rewards good plays, not lucky creation of cards!",1
16369,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewGreat card game, which is also the only card game out of many I have tried that I come back to play for over a month. Usually I get bored of card games pretty fast. This is a beautiful exception however. :)",1
16370,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewLike many others, I came to Eternal from the RNG fiesta that is Hearthstone currently. This game is truly a breath of fresh air in today's digital CCG landscape.PROS:1. Although there are microtransactions, this game is truly F2P thanks to the generous rewards system. For example, in Draft Mode (like Arena in Hearthstone) you get to keep ALL 48 cards that you choose, on top of the usual rewards for winning. There are also free random cards and gold for ranked wins.2. Minimal RNG. However, because of the way the mana system works (similar to lands in MTG) you can get mana screwed but proper deck building should mitigate this,3. Interactive combat system. This is similar to MTG where you can take some actions (e.g. Fast Spells) on your opponent's turn, such as when he attacks you. Again, I compare this to Hearthstone where you pretty much can't do anything on your opponent's turn.4. Complex strategy. The cards in the first set are varied and allow for many different deck types. There are 5 factions and you can have all 5 in your deck (albeit risk getting mana screwed). 5. Complex tactics. Here I'm talking about the skill you need to assess the board state and make plays. Each player can have up to 14(?) units on the board and this can lead to deliciously challenging decisions - which units do I attack with and when? which  of my opponent's units do I block and with what units?CONS:1. Clunky UI. This is a minor gripe as it's already in a decent state, just needs a few tweaks.2. Small player base. This game isnt hugely popular now and there aren't alot of web resources (no net decks :(). Hopefully with the steam release this game will pick up in numbers.Overall this game is one of the better CCGs out there. And it's F2P, so there's really no reason not to install it and give it a go.",1
16371,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI have had used Steam for about 12 years and this is my first ever steam review. This game is fantastic.It's easy to pick up but there is lots of tactical and strategic room for growth. Some say it is like Hearthstone but much better, and I would agree with that. It has a healthier economy (ie it is more rewarding and gives you more cards without having to spend money). But if you want to spend money to speed up your collection, that is always an option.I would compare it more to the card game Magic the Gathering. It takes the best of Magic and Hearthstone and leaves the worst out.The single player campaigns are pretty fun and give you a good start for your collection, then there are several game modes to play after that: Gauntlet (free AI challenge with decent rewards) Forge (draft mode against AI where you get to keep the cards you draft) Draft (draft mode against other people where you keep the cards you draft) Puzzles (exasctly what it sounds like--puzzles to help you learn strategy and game mechanics) Casual (unranked play against player opponents) Ranked (ranked ladder play against player opponents)The card quality is great, and the game is surprisingly well balanced. The developers have done a great job to maintain balance in the card pool. There is diversity in the ""meta,"" which is to say that there hasn't been one single deck that has dominated over everything else, because every strategy can be countered.The game is still pretty new, and there is only the base set and one expansion set out so far, but there are already a TON of cards and there is no shortage of cards or ideas for decks. The game was just made in a way that makes sense, and the devs have really put alot of thought into it. Have a cool deck you want to share with your friend? Easy, there is an export button in-game. Find a cool deck online that you want to try out? Easy--you can copy the deck and import it with one button. Super user-friendly.If you are interested in theorycrafting, there is a great community here, on reddit, and other forums as well. People post deck lists all the time and there are plenty of startegy articles to get you started. Here are a couple sites that are pretty popular to check out: www.reddit.com/r/EternalCardGame  (reddit discussions) www.rngeternal.com  (discussions about strategy, meta, etc.) www.eternalwarcry.com  (easy place to post a deck idea or see what others have come up with)All in all, cannot recommend this game enough to anyone who is interested in this type of game. Good luck, and I hope you try it out!",1
16372,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewMagic : the Gathering is known as a definition of TCG, but at some point with all those expansions and new mechanics it became incredibly complicated and unfriendly to new players. Soon after that Blizzard released Hearthstone, the renown digital CCG, which quickly got well deserved popularity as a casual and easy-to-get-in f2p game. But few years later Hearthstone now comes alongside with some issues. Mostly its RNG based mechanics and debatable balance of some cards, coming with new expansions and adventures. So the story kinda repeats itself and Hearthstone gets more and more complicated and hard for a new player, just like Magic did. At this point people that were hooked in by HS start looking for something else, with less RNG and more skill-based( or rather prediction-based) gameplay. And here we are, looking at this beautiful game called Eternal, with great art-style, Magic-like mechanics and casual feeling of Hearthstone. The game is evenly interesting, fun and complex.Summary:The game is fresh and worth at least checking it out. Beautiful graphics, interesting mechanics, but still casual enough to enjoy even small sessions of game. ",1
16373,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewPretty good indeed,If you are related to other card games it is more complicated that hearthstone but not as much as magic.

It's the best online TCG I've ever played, and almost better than live Magic: The Gathering.People have issues with the deck size being too big and getting ""mana probs"", but those individuals have probably never played Magic. It all just depends on balancing mana, and that's a problem that is easily remedied by just learning how to build properly.As well - DON'T PLAY ONLINE UNLESS YOU HAVE A BETTER DECK THAN THE BEGINNER SERIES.The matchmaking system cares not for your deck contents, so you will be matched with higher tier decks than yours. Beat the campaign first, amass coins in Gauntlet, get some new cards, and build a better deck first.Amazing game, wonderful content, awesome gameplay, long-running battles (provided your opponent doesn't play aggro decks) with absolutely wicked plays that can be made with the larger mana draw this game has compared to Magic. 10/10, would recommend again.",1

16378,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewA lot of people are complaining about the resource system being unfair, which is ridiculous. If you've ever played MTG before, you know that sometimes you get mana swamped/screwed. That's just the nature of card games. The game is brilliant otherwise, it's everything I liked about MTG and Hearthstone put together in a system that gives you gold and packs way quicker than Hearthstone, but is free, unlike MTG. Would highly recommend this game. Only issue I see right now is that the tutorial takes quite a while, which probably deters a lot of new players. If you get past that, however, it's great!",1
16379,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you've ever played Hearthstone or Magic: The Gathering, this is the real digital experience for you. Magic is a fantastic game, but it's old and doesn't translate well to online play. Hearthstone is quick and easy but lacks a lot of interaction with your opponent and always felt a bit flat to me. Eternal is the best of both worlds, with some extras. The game is silky smooth like Hearthstone, with some cool extra modes like Forge (AI controlled draft/Arena) and easy ""grinding"" (You will get cards at a *much* faster rate than in Hearthstone and have more choices in how to grind). On top of that it has stellar game play like I've come to expect from a much deeper game like Magic: The Gathering. It's hard to recommend this game highly enough. I went from playing Magic Online 30hrs or more a week to playing Eternal for 40 or more and it's swiftly looking to become my main stream game as well as something I actually enjoy playing off-stream as well. AAA quality here.",1

You can actually get enough cards by playing the game to be competative.Unlike most other CCG, you can climb the ladder with the generous free to play model.  This would be impossible in hearthstone without spending several hundred dollars.The gameplay mechanics are fluid and solid.The discord channel is very active and helpful.Old Review: This game is fun.  You gotta play it a little while to see the depth and differances from other CCG.",1
16383,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewIs basically a poor man's MtG, is REALLY alike, a little bit simpler but that's it.This game have pretty much the same pro and cons that magic does.Pros: pretty fun, good game play, good amount of diferent decks in the meta.Cons: Mana curve can be really upseting if u came from Hearthstone, and in the Eternal Case is worse than MtG cuz they had a not really good idea of using a 75 cards deck and more cards means less reliability...There's the point that is a really F2P game, in a very small time i could get a competitive deck and got to the top rank, but MtG can also be seeing as an investment since u can actually win some money playing, that isnt the case of Eternal. ",0
16384,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game mechanics are good, the meta is somewhat diverse (a lot more diverse than in Hearthstone) and if they keep up with balancing and adding more cards, I can see this becoming big.",1
16385,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is the best digital card game out there. It's super fun, creatively designed, well-balanced, runs perfectly, and is ENORMOUSLY generous as a free-to-play model game.Eternal plays like a refined version of Magic: the Gathering, with tons of card designs only possible in a digital environment.The tutorial is a little slow, but once you get through it and can freely draft/build decks/play ladder the game really opens up!If you like card games, you'll probably love this. Give it a shot, it's free!",1
16386,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewDespite its several (still) unresolved issues (mana screw/flood, long and boring tutorial and unbalanced match pairings) Eternal Card Game can be considered as one of the best CCGs online at the moment. This is achieved thanks to two solid pillars: its extremely generous reward system and all the features that borrows from both Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering. The reward system and the Arena Mode (which allows you to keep all the drafted cards) make building a reasonable collection quite fast and easy. Eternal combines the combat  keywords (flying, trample, deathtouch...) mechanics from Magic with interactions and mechanics like echo (when you draw a card with this hability, it copies itself), or warcry (the next criature gains +1+1). Interactions that would be impossible in a physical game, but without the heavy RNG of Hearthstone. To sum up, Eternal is a great card  game with a lot of potential that doesnt treat you like trash if you are a Free to play player. Dont let the arid tutorial discourage you!",1
16387,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI come from a Magic: the Gathering background. I've played MtG for 16-17 years and have always been active, playing in major tournaments and even competing at the World Magic Cup. I just want you to have that information before reading the next line:Eternal has replaced MtG for me!Yeap, you read it right. I just love this game. DWDigital went and made a card game which gives me magic level quality with a lot of digital only abilities and perks which I can enjoy day in and day out with multiple formats to compete in.The drafting experience is especially awesome and it completely replaces the favorite part of MtG for me which was draft. There is signaling, synergies you name it!The community is amazing as well, with community organized weekly tournaments, culminating with the community organized World Championship.If you are a fan of card games with high level of strategy, this one is for you!",1
16388,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI'm staying with this one. After trying many TCG's (including Magic, off course) I should say Eternal is the one that best fulfill s my expectations for this type of game. The strategic depth of this game and its balance (there are still some minor balance issues but hey, it's early access and that kind of analysis takes time) are way better than Hearthstone's. There is a good player base and overall feels solid.",1
16389,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewMy favorite digital card game. Challenging, rewarding, and easy on the wallet.Pros:-Mechanically intensive.-Interactive gameplay. You can cast spells and choose blockers on your opponent's turn.-F2P friendly; the daily rewards are very generous.-Great solo play options that reap real in-game rewards.-Positive, helpful community.-Constant new content and balance patchesCons:-If you have PTSD from getting mana screwed in MTG, this game is just as bad.-The game could be more polished visually. Not a fan of the game's graphics.",1
16390,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI've played many card games throughout the years but this one is by far my favorite. I looked for a new card game because Hearthstone's new expansion pretty much made everthing one dimensional, so I tried shadowverse, and I tried this game. At first I was more into shadowverse because you get tons of packs just starting off and the card art is pretty sweet, but I've grown to love this game and the card art has grown on me too. I've spent a lot of time on this game, and tbh even though the packs are 1000/pack you don't even need to buy them. You could definitely F2P this game because you get TONS of packs from quests, lvling, etc. If you're looking for a card game that you can enjoy, definitely give this one a chance, i didn't regret it.",1
16391,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is my first Steam review and it's for a great game! If you're looking for a game to scratch that Magic itch before Arena comes out, look no further! Developed by some top MTG pros (LSV, Chapin) and it definitely shows. Coming from Magic I love the combat and the Power/Influence system. There are things in this game that couldn't be done with a paper card game, like persistent effects in the void (graveyard), buffing cards in your deck before drawing them, and stealing units end up in your void. There are less opportunites to respond to actions than Magic, but more than HS and it keeps games moving quickly. It is definitely the most F2P CCG out there, the game practically throws packs and gold at you if you keep up with quests and events. They often have events in game that you break even in terms of gold/value without putting up a stellar performance. I've spent 25$ on this game but it's only been for cosmetic items, I don't even need to spend the gems (real $$ currency) because I have more than enough gold and shiftstone (crafting currency) to do what I want to do. At the time of this review there are 3 sets out and 2 campaigns which is already a pretty good card pool with more on the horizon. The development team of Direwolf Digital are great with their interaction with the community.The initial tutorial is a bit long, but they give you a nice stash of gold and base cards to start with. There are two AI modes that give pretty good rewards. One is a Forge, a draft-lite experience, you pick one of three card options and then are presented with 3 more cards, and so on until you have a deck. You keep all cards from Draft and Forge, no phantom drafts here! The other AI format is Gauntlet, where you play a deck of your choice through a Gauntlet of AI decks, with one loss ending the run. At the end of the run you fight a Boss deck that has a specific ""gimmick"" that may benefit or hurt both players (i.e. both players start with 3 power, when you play a unit play a random weapon on it, etc.) Whenever I get burned out playing PVP I like to reset with a Gauntlet or Forge run.",1
16392,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewHaving played mostly Magic The Gathering in real life I can say, it's definitely a lot of fun! I didn't have any mana/power issues in my games so far. The solo campaign and game modes are motivating and make for at least some hours of worthwile free-to-play content. The client runs smoothly and the interface is visually pleasing. If your are interested in an online TCG, you should give it try!",1
16393,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Incredibly generous free model. I have not spent a penny and have many decks and several legendaries. Literally showers you with cards. Gameplay is pretty great. Decks are 75 cards. Lots of interesting effects, few cards with no text. Multiple solo play and versus play modes. Lots of opportunities for thematic builds and neat combos.

Can't wait to play against some of you awesome Ladies and Gents out there.",1
16399,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewGood mechanics, somewhere between Hearthstone Plus and M:TG Lite. Very generous F2P implementation. Good fun without screwing the pooch for monetization. Highly recommended if you're looking for a digital CCG.",1
16400,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis has been my go-to for over a year.  It feels like the depth of M:tG, but they've made it play smoother in a digital space.  It's truly free-to-play.  New players can quickly collect enough to have at least one very competitive deck, and build up from there.  There is a draft format where the cards you pick are added to your collection.  There are free repeatable puzzles (available after the tutorial) that start simple and go quite deep into the rules and interactions in the game.The tutorial is just plain too long, so if you decide to give Eternal a try, prepare yourself for that.  Have some nice snacks and a ball game to watch or something.",1

16402,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis is the best free digital card game PERIOD.If you can slog through the tutorial this is the magic-like you've always wanted. Probably the most generous reward system of any card game out there.,1
16403,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewCurrently the best CCG I've found. Gets round some of the things that can make a game of MTG unfun, with less mana screw or floods, without removing the tactical mana thinking. Less randomness & more proper thinking than Hearthstone (although there are a few cards that are a bit random). Far less bland than the Elder Scrolls card game - indeed, the world building is pretty fun.Give it a go. It's generous with free cards, and the legendaries are mostly not super overpowered (except maybe Sandstorm Titan...). Plus, if this means anything to you, it's developed by LSV, a titan himself. Just a fun, well developed game.",1
16404,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThe new set of cards are to OP and basically force you into spending a ton of money make new top tier decks. There random dealling is broken beyond belief. Its not even a good copy of magic. Not worth your money or time.,0

16406,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewMy favorite digital CCG by a wide margin, and I've tried them all. There's always a different way to play: puzzles (some of which are really head scratching and reveal good interactions between cards), AI constructed, AI draft, ladder, draft, the frequent event. Event are usually fun and well worth your time and gold. Fun to play and very generous; I turned 2 packs worth of gold into 6 packs this past weekend. Playtime on here doesn't reflect my time playing on the very good mobile client.Mana screw / flood does happen. It's the price you pay for completely open deck building. It can be frustrating, but games are quick and it's just a game. If you want a low variance card game, play something else. I've played hundreds of Eternal games and I'm glad each one played out differently.The tutorial and opening hour(s) of the game are not great though. It just goes on for way too long. Once everything is unlocked though, you'll have a very generous F2P game.",1
16407,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI can't help feeling that I've played games that executed everything better while I'm playing this game.I hate to make comparisons, but it was so goddamn easy to do while I was trying out the campaign. When I was dead drawing resources, I kept on flashing back to Spellweaver and how eloquent it made the resource management aspect. When I saw the ability to permanently modify cards you didn't even have in hand, Hex did it better, and made it so ubiquitous and fun that it became the defining feature of that game. It also has this Hearthstone design and vibe with how quick everything is supposed to be and how gameplay ramps, but then again Hearthstone already does that (and Shadowverse does it way better).Nothing felt particularly interesting about this game. I've spent so little time with it, yet I felt like I've seen everything it had to offer in the tutorial, and I've seen it done better everywhere else. I felt motivated to leave a non-recommendation in just half an hour, and not out of the fact that any part of it is bad, but that it was so tepid and lackluster that I couldn't understand why the game had such a positive review score at the time.Just, why?I have to come back and comment even more. Why have land draws that can do absolutely nothing to advance your game? I don't get it. That's the most luck based mechanic ever devised; drawing something, your only avenue of increasing your choices; that can be completely dead, yet necessary to your game. Every game after Magic tried to avoid that, and Eternal runs headfirst into it. Even when Hex did it, they at least gave you charges for a hero power so you were building up to something.",0
16408,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewDo you enjoy Hearthstone and MTG but die a little inside every time you throw $5 at the fat greedy ballsacks running the over-indulgent BS machine that is the competetive tcg scene? WELL I'VE GOT A GAME FOR YOU! Spend as little time or money as you want and still succeed at schooling the guy who spent $50 on that extra foiled sigil collection just to show you that he's got a tiny member. When they say you are only limited by your creativity they mean it. You can win or LOSE with as much flair as your heart desires and it's always fun. Minimal potential for overly-abusive control mechanics that grind the game to a halt but if you hate yourself and everyone around you then you can do that too! It's just not going to save you from the world of hurt coming your way in the form of a needlessly aggresive snow-goblin based smackdown. This is the most fair gameplay to reward system I've seen in a digital ccg yet with free participation based promos, events that you can buy into with your hard-earned coins, and daily packs just for showing up. Not to mention the awesome holiday festivity! I have no reservations about tossing some money at the developer for the awesome job they'd done ripping off a popular system and shoving the perfect example of what could've been right in the faces of their progenitors!

Makes the ladder, which is bo1, a mind numbingly boring experience, since almost everyone and their dog wanting to climb plays that card either because it's good, or because the same colors are needed to remove it.Can't wait till someone wants to make money by making a good card game, rather than make money with dubious ""buy this powercreep here guise"" type deals. Shame because there's obviously talent here, but design decisions tell me all I need to know. What matters isn't where you are, it's which direction you're going. And this isn't going in any good direction.Got banned and lost all account access after posting this review: lol.

16412,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewSo far, the game mechanics are very similar to, yet distinct from, a mix of MtG and Hearthstone.  I will say that the game flows much better and faster than either of those two, and the rules are not as ambiguous nor as tedious to memorize as either of the other two.As for Eternal, itself, being able to mix and match elements coherently is nice, while not being constrained on character choice based on how my deck plays was cool, as well.  I've only so far completed the first chapter of the campaign and some of the battles in the second chapter, and I'm really excited to say that it feels like the kind of card game I could sink hours into and get a lot done in at the same time.I'd like to see what Direwolf does in the future and more of the game before I offer any criticisms or suggestions, and thus far, I have not encountered any bugs in the game, myself.",1

The pace of the games feel comfortable quickly, and good balancing keeps meta's interesting. There seems to always be more then one metadeck, this game feels far from stale. Competitively different decks come out on top every time, whilst RNG doesn't have to much impact to be annoying.All in all this is a captivating, highly enjoyable and highly addictive game.

16416,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewReward system used to be pretty generous, but they scaled it back. This is totally backward and the price to craft specifically ""legendary"" rarity cards is too high.

16417,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access ReviewEternal is such a good card game. The way they are able to make cool and new mechanics while still making it fair and balanced is astonishing. I genuinely hope this game blows up as I want more people to like the game as much as I do :) ,1
16418,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewWriting reviews isn't really my thing, but I will make an exception for Eternal. Most people will look at it and think Hearthstone, but it's closest kin is really Magic the Gathering. I say that, but there's some major design changes from the MTG format - often things that will take advantage of the digital format, such as permanently altering the stats and abilities of cards even when they change zones (Battlefield to graveyard, etc.Regardless, what most of you will want to know is how hard is it to get into the game? Well let me just say it's about the most generous card game I've played. You earn at least one pack every day, you earn gold fairly quickly every day (enough to grind out a draft), draft modes let you keep every card you pick, the game gives away packs like hotcakes early on, and finally you can always get free drops (cards, packs, draft tickets) from watching streams (which happens to be a great way to learn!). If you want a good newbie friendly streamer to watch, check out LocoPojo or KaelosTheReckoning.Last but not least, there's a decent single player experience to be had as well, including several campaigns, puzzles, and a hearthstone-style draft mode vs an AI.",1
16419,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Hm... Where do I start... Eternal is a very good Digital CG I played this game recently (Lesser than 2 weeks), and This game shows so many potential to improve, the unique mechanics of the game itself is shown, and It's really Free to play friendly. I have played another Digital CG like Shadowverse and Hearthstone, but This game has shown so many uniqueness and It's really worth to play or try. Unique Mechanics & Fun Gameplay First to start, it has 5 different factions to play, which you can combine it either 2 factions, 3 or even 5 of all factions in one deck, making total 120 Different Faction deck combinations to play. Interesting keywords and mechanics on each factions makes the uniqueness appealing as you can play cards from another faction and combine into your deck, making new combo and wide strategy in deck building.In the game, you can play PvP casual, Play vs AI to test your deck and get rewards, Pay to Build a random deck based on random cards you choose against AI and get rewards + You keep the cards, or Pay to build a random deck based on random cards u choose against another player and get rewards + You keep the cards. This shows that by spending your money, you get exactly what you get, and it's really worth it.Quests are very unique, as if you are a new player playing the game, you will get quests with free deck and you have to win the selected free deck. This indeed are worth, as (maybe) other card games never have such mechanism that gives players a lot of stuff as a new player and F2P.On the Board, You would start with 7 cards (6 if you redraw it for the second time, only works against PvP), which you can redraw your cards for getting guarantee 2-4 sigils (Sigils is a power card that uses as ""Mana"" to use to summon monsters/spells.). I think the Dev did a good job for the Redraw mechanism that has been updated recently. You can have >10 monsters on board, and Your deck is a combination from 75 - 150 cards, so it makes sure you will not deck out for a long time and can add a lot of space to add some monster/spells. F2P and New player Friendly Unlike other card games, Eternal is very VERY generous to it's player.1.) At the tutorials you will be given 5 Decks, well structured and balanced. 2.) New player Quests & Everyday Quests gives you Either Cards or Boosters.3.) A new deck will be given for free as a quest. You keep the cards forever.4.) Everyday you can get a free Booster by winning a pvp game, either casual or ranked.5.) Rewarding you for playing, Against AI or Players.So I would not say anything else, since this actually gave players to expand the cards they have and explore deeper for each cards.Now let's talk what it lacks. It lacks of proper explaination on cards Some card/keywords are very confusing for new players. I feel that this can make confusion and players may use it as suicidal action when playing against another player or AI, and maybe, makes new players don't want to try something new because it's complicated. It needs a new Wording on the cards, so players may understand how a card works. For experienced players they already know what it does based on their experience, but for newer players, It may makes them don't want to play the card that offers unique keyword/unique skill. Tutorials. I don't know if there's a Skip button on tutorials, but just for note, playing tutorial takes 1 hour if you are a slow player like me. It has an exciting storyline but it gets boring by the half of the storyline because you need to play your deck, like, going to set your deck and stuff, so tutorials is considered as one of the cons. However, Don't take this point as a reason you don't want to play the game, as it offers a good gameplay afterwards.  Because it has thick deck and a lot of cards, it's very confusing to make one deck. Unlieke hearthstone with 9 classes and 30 cards, which with 30 cards you know what subclass you are playing, what's inside or composition of 30 cards, Eternal has giving it's players to have 75 - 150 cards on its deck. In my 12 hours of playing, I haven't created a single deck from myself, only one wacky deck. because it's very complicated to build, like you have to consider how much sigils, spells, and monsters. (Relics and weps too). Eternal is wide when it comes to card lists, but that's why it's complicated, and thus newer players need to play this a bit longer and deeper before making his choice of deck.The only i made from the deck was an all to face deck which consists all of my units attacking opponent face and make them die as quick as possible. Played it for 5 matches and the win ratio is 60% (3 Wins 2 Loses).   Overall  In conclusion, this game is complicated and fun. Any players who is interested playing CGs, new to CG or experienced people who have at least played CGs, should play this game. Try it, feel the game as it keep growing slowly.My rating : 9.1/10",1

16423,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI had fun for the first few hours I played, but the MAC version has some serious performance issues.

When I play it, it slows down all other applications to point where they are unresponsive, even browsing websites in Chrome.After a couple of patch cycles, I'll check it out again and see if they have fixed their stuff, but I don't have any interest in playing this when it drains my entire battery in about a hour and grinds my entire machine to a crawl",0
16424,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI'm an ex MTG player.  I played hearthstone for quite some time before moving onto other ccgs and I'm currently enjoying shadowverse.  This review may come off extremely critical, but with so many f2p online ccgs to choose from, I feel it's warrented.Your power (resource) cards are drawn from the same pile as your other cards.  This leads to flooding and not getting enough power far too frequently.  Since this is a digital card game there are several better options and there is no need for this serious problem to occur.  If they wanted to have players draw the power cards, they could have just made two seperate draw piles for resources and non-power cards and let the player choose what they want to draw to avoid this.Going first has a large advantage.  The only thing you get for going second is you draw first (firs player skips their initial draw).  That's not enough to make up for being the player that's constantly reacting to your opponent's plays since you're basically a turn behind.Some cards are obviously ""pushed"" too far.  Some cards have stats and abilities well above what they should have at their cost and are often put at higher rarity which makes them harder to obtain for new players.  While some colors need these to be balanced compaired to the other colors, this is still at the very least a poor and lazy way to balance. Eternal currently has no casual play, only ranked.  Why would it take so long to implament this very basic game mode?  If you're fine with only playing ranked as I am, then it's a non-issue, however I know other players get anxiety when they play in ranked modes or just want a place to test things out and mess around when they don't feel up to playing ranked so I thought others should at least be aware.These next couple are just things I didn't like about eternal, but wouldn't call inherantly negative parts of the game.Defender decides what is blocked and how the blocks occur.  This leads to too many board stalls.Damage is wiped from units at the end of the turn.  Again this leads to board stalls since you can't just chip down a big minion over time and you often won't want to attack with it either since your opponent can assign multiple blockers and kill it if it attacks.This game isn't all bad though, I did like being able to play against the AI to earn some chests (which contain cards).  The drafting process was also well done.  UI and art are decent enough.If you have no fast spells (cards that can be played on your opponent's turn) the game doesn't require an ""ok"" to progress the game which does help speed things up a bit.  However if a player does have a fast spell, then the game requires you to push a button in between plays to progress.  Players should be able to quickly tell the time difference in between plays and know that you have a fast spell.  This information can/will cause different plays vs. if the player didn't have that information.TL;DR There are better f2p ccgs for me.  If you're looking for something closer to MTG than hearthstone, and the above issues don't bother you, then it's worth a shot.",0
16425,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewPlayed this game for Last few months. The game catches the attention and is great... Most of the time. even spent some money on it. But all and all the RNG makes you mana screwed or flooded 2/3 games. Cant climb ranks 32 mana in my 75 card deck get stuck on 2 mana 5 games in a row. other than that game seem like it could be fun.,0
16426,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewVery fun game.  Been playing for about 3 weeks now, and I've completely abandoned Hearthstone in favor of this.  Nice MtG  type combat, good card economy, deep strategic thinking.",1
16427,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game is very fun at first but gets boring very quickly. You basically have to beat the campaign to actually get started with new cards. The campaign is fast and kind of easy, and after you beat it there's nothing specific to really do. The quests are alright but not that interesting (for the most part).",0
16428,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewAll of my time is on mobile which is why I don't have many hours logged on steam. However I have played this game quite a lot. As far as online card games go, this one is by far my favorite. It has more depth than Hearthstone and gives you a lot more freedom. The game is also incredibly generous and it's very possible to get enough cards to make viable decks without paying at all. Wondeful game, great mechanics, generous devs. Can't reccomend this enough :)",1
16429,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI think this is probably the best digital card game running right now.Imagine Magic: The Gathering, with Hearthstone's slick UI & interesting digital-only mechanics, while minimizing its annoying RNG elements.Very generous for free to play players, I've invested a minimal amount in this game, about $20 to unlock content I didn't feel like grinding for, and have still found myself able to construct high tier decks in a much shorter timeframe than other digital card games.That said, not sure if I'd really recommend as a game for casual play.  Generous as it is, it's still a card game, and starting a collection from 0 is rough.  The amount of time (in days) it takes for a casual player to be able to put together a competitive deck may be offputting for some.In brief: If you're a fan of Magic: The Gathering, or strategy card games in general, definitely at least give this one a try.  You probably won't regret it.",1
16430,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is simply amazing for those players looking for a collectible card game. It is playable both on your phone/tablet and steam, so you always have it when you want a game. It is amazingly free-to-play. New players are often able to build a competitive deck in a couple weeks. Best of all, you keep the cards you draft.",1
16431,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access ReviewA great card game that is absolutely not pay to win and gives you many opportunities to get new decks without resorting to IRL money. 100% wins over hearthstone and other card games I have played.,1
16432,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewI agree with the poster that said this is the game that we all wished Hearthstone would have been. I am having a huge amount of fun with this game. It is made well & walks you through the basics very effectively.,1
16433,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewComing from a background of playing several differenct TCGs, I can cay that this game certantly has a better paying power curve than most, with all of the cards being availible through standard play (though the rarer cards will probably require some grinding to get).",1
16434,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal CCG is one of the best games out there. The free to play experince has been the best that I have had out of all card games. The community is super nice and wants everyone to succeed. The game has the best aspects of all ccgs, and there game doesn't feel boring or stale like other games. There isn't a whole lot of streamers and youtube videos out there on the game however. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys card games such as Magic, Hearthstone and the like.",1
16435,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal is my favorite digital card game. I've been playing this game too long not to have contributed a glowing review.It's probably the game I've played most for the past few years, and it continues to improve with updates and expansions. I'd recommend trying it out since it's generously free to play and has some really fun moments. It offers single player content when you aren't up for PvP and regularly hosts weekend events with special rules. It's pretty easy to earn the rewards and build a collection, whether you're looking for a competitive deck or something more imaginative and entertaining. There are also multiple modes that build your collection as you play, rather than requiring the more expensive decks full of impossibly rare cards.I'll also add that some of the people who have made or helped build this game are long-time MTG pros and former developers, so to say it is a rip-off is actually misleading. It isn't the same as lifting someone else's concept when these devs created some of that concept (I can see how that would be confusing, though). Either way, it deserves some attention!",1
16436,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewHere's a little back ground.I play some hearthstone. I play a LOT of Netrunner, Doom Town Reloaded, Ashes etc....This is a really good game. I was holding off on reviewing this for a bit because I wanted to get a feel for how quickly you can score card packs, and how the F2P grind is.Honestly.... it's reasonable. Packs cost 1000 of the free currency, which I almost have enough of to buy one. However.... you get alot of cards out of a single pack. 12 cards, just counted.This game is deeply strategic when compared to the competition. It's fun to play, and there's lots left to learn in this game.",1
16437,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewA shockingly great card game. If, like me, you find other digital TCGs like Hearthstone to be a bit too shallow, then Eternal is probably for you. It combines the depth and complexity of MtG with new mechanics that would only be possible in a digital game and the result is easy to learn, hard to master, and definitely fun to play. Adding to its greatness is the fact that Eternal is ridiculously generous for an F2P game. Seriously, they give you so many free packs on such a regular basis that more frugal players can still experience everything that makes the game great.I highly recommend it.(Don't trust the hour count, I play mostly on mobile)",1
16438,Eternal Card Game,,"of cards, abilities, etc which means:Diversity of decks - new things to tryYou earn cards pretty quickly just by playing a little each dayCons:The deck size and power system leaves a lot of the game up to RNG. Drawing or not drawing sigils 3+ turns in a row usually means a loss regardless of your decks strength or your momentum. Conclusion: It's a fun game that you can enjoy free to play if you wish and make steady progress. You unlock cards at a rate that keeps you interested and you can make pretty decent decks early on. Granted you'll still have trouble beating players that drop 6+ legendaries in a game...The power system will make you rage at some point. You'll be thinking of Hearthstone and the predictable nature of the mana curve.If you want a predictable card game stick to Hearthstone. If you want variety and can deal with being on the short stick side of RNG try out Eternal. ",1
16439,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewEdit: one minor gripe. As you keep playing, even once you max out Gauntlet and Forge, the enemies keep getting harder. This normally would be an okay thing, but it eventually becomes impossible. While the game is very rewarding, it doesn't reward you enough to keep up with the increasing difficulty, and increasing legendary cards your AI opponents will play on you. Eventually you're reduced to playing Gauntlets and hoping for them to get crap hands the entire match, or else risk being reduced to getting Wooden Chests for your efforts. This REALLY forces you into a wall. And even buying packs won't help, because they seldom ever give you any cards that boost your ability. A legendary drop from a card pack is an extremely rare thing. This makes it feel like you're reduced to waiting for seasons to reset, so you can start beating opponents for rewards again. Been playing it on mobile more than Steam. So my time is low on here. I highly recommend to MTG and Hearthstone fans that are looking for something a bit more rewarding. This game really doesn't reach for your wallet at all. And it's very friendly towards people that just want to play Solo against AI. It doesn't force you to play other people to earn currency/packs like Hearthstone does. I do wish you could clear out the daily quests from the forced mutliplayer stuff, however. The mechanics are closer to MTG than Hearthstone. But the attributes of cards (charge, deadly, etc) follow more closely to Hearthstone than MTG.It has a good sized campaign, which mostly sits as your tutorial. There's a Gauntlet mode, reminscent of HS's Arena mode, though you'll pick your deck before hand. There's a Forge mode that's exactly like Arena from HS, picking between 3 cards up until your deck is finished, then battling a series of opponents.  I've really only checked the Solo side of things. I know MP has Ranked and Casual, and a Draft. I've heard rumblings that some decks are unbalanced in MP (aggro decks that kill before you can even get your mana up). But I can't really speak on that. I guess I can see where you can make some insane OP decks. But that's kind of the fun part. I've been doing the same, and ranking up in Gauntlet. This game throws free packs, and currency at you like i've never seen in a FTP game before. It's very generous. You will get plenty of cards for your collection if you play regularly.EDIT: Still really enjoying this game a few days later. which is unusual for me. I usually binge on a game, and then am done with it after a few days. This game is just so rewarding. I'm playing Gauntlets, Forges, and Drafts, and the game just throws gold, crafting shards, and packs at you like crazy. The satisfaction of building a successful deck, and trying new strategies really keeps this game going for me. Comparing decks on websites like EternalWarcry, and planning my next deck is a big plus too. Again, I really have a high recommendation for this game.Update - July 16,2018: One minor gripe. When the game absolutely wants you to lose, you're going to lose. You'll either draw no mana, or all mana and no minions/powers. Or the opposing AI will topdeck a perfect game on you. It just happens sometimes. So be prepared for that. I really wish they'd adjust the AI/RNG for that. It's PAINFULLY obvious when you're getting blocked from a win on a Forge/Gauntlet or otherwise AI match. You can tell when there's a fair exchange after playing a few weeks. And then you can tell when the game just absolutely doesn't want you to win.",1
16440,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you ever wondered what Hearthstone would be like with the mana, blocking and “fast spells” of Magic look no further than Eternal!The story mode is an excellent introduction to the game, and it unlocks 5 decks for you. I would have been happier if it was shorter or included deck construction though.They made the wise choice of allowing you to use the same account on mobile and PC, allowing you to play anywhere on the device of your choosing.Ultimately it’s a solid game. I won’t be staying with it as I have other games which fit my interests more, but you could certainly do worse than Eternal. ",1

16443,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewLovely card game, mixing some of the best things of Magic (more bluffing, counter spells) and Hearthstone (interface, easy playing).

There's a decent collection already present and updated frequently.",1
16444,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewCollectible deckbuilding card games can be a lot of fun.  They are not, however, a legitimate form of mind-to-mind competition.  They're certainly enticing and stimulating, to be sure.  The illusory pull of being able to come up with strategies and collect cards to support that strategy, building from a core idea into a set of techniques, and then unleashing them in matches, testing, refining, it all sounds very cool.  The problem is, in the internet era, an individual's efforts just don't amount to much.  And furthermore, there's far too much luck involved.Sure, you can make progress, as I've done with homebrew decks from time to time, depending on whether the meta allows for the strategies I try.  But for the vast majority of players, you must pay to win and bow to the whims of how the community is building its decks.The specific games in the CCG genre all have their quirks, but in every instance, you're up against the meta.  The game is less about refining your own ideas than it is about efficiently farming cards to steal the ideas of others that have been tested in far more matches than you could ever hope to play on your own.  It's about taking advantage of momentary swings and imbalances in particular card combinations, looking for a weak spot that will rocket you up a few more notches against a ton of other people trying to do the same.  You're not testing your own ideas so much as testing the ideas of the community and its ever-shifting whims, and then changing tactics when you get countered.I don't find the idea of trying to eke out a more than 50% winrate with decks I didn't make up very appealing.  Nor do I like the idea that all my individual efforts are mostly for naught when compared to a whole internet full of people using particular premade netdecks that far outclass me, throwing hundreds of dollars at the game to get all the cards they need.  Sure, I can try to scrape something together and compete, I can appropriate their techniques, but all I'm doing is playing the odds, hoping I draw into lucky strings of cards to make my combos work, hoping they don't draw into theirs.  Hoping that if we both draw into our deck's ultimate concept, that mine trumps theirs in the meta, that they aren't set up to counter me.  I've done pretty well with my homebrew decks, but once you're mired in the silver ranks, you'll start running into decks using enormous amounts of synergistic legendaries that were most likely bought with real money.  Sometimes, draw luck is on your side, other times, it's not.Don't get me wrong, this is still fun a lot of the time.  But it is not a direct competition between minds.  There's too much other crap in the way.  There's a certain amount of skill involved in playing the cards/decks correctly, but at their heart, CCGs are a matter of who has the time and the luck, who is willing to steal the best ideas efficiently.Compare the strategies in CCGs to the strategy found in a game like Go, for instance, where every piece has the same properties and the rules are very simple with no randomness, yet the depth of potential strategies is so all-consuming that people dedicate their whole lives to the game, and the game is capable of opening itself up to higher and higher levels of play as you progress.  In a card game, the pieces you even have access to are based on either your wallet or grinding out the hours.  In a sense, this might be similar on the surface in that more time = more power.  But there's no set of pieces you unlock by studying Go for 1000 hours that will automatically win games for you once they're all out on the board.  You're never stuck with pieces in your bowl that are unplayable because you lack some other amount of power, or finding that you reach into the bowl and there's no stones in there to draw out and play.  Your ideas have a direct expression on the board at all times, and the better your ideas, the stronger your purpose and the more efficient your play, the better you are at the game in a direct correlation.So, all that said, Eternal is still a pretty good example of a game in this genre.  It's pretty close to M:TG, and has a lot of great elements that make it shine with a hell of a lot less RNG than, say, Hearthstone.  The attacking and blocking mechanics engender some interesting mindgames and back and forth.  But it's still a collectible card game at the end of the day, and bound by those same limitations.I'll finish this out by saying that while I still do play Eternal quite a lot, and I usually enjoy my time with it, I can only provisionally recommend it to those who are willing to put up with the usual pay-to-win collectible card game frustrations present in every example of this genre.  If you're up for struggling quite a bit against factors outside of your control, for the sake of the occasional dopamine rush of an earned win interspersed with a lot of unearned wins and losses, well, you could do worse than Eternal.  It certainly whiles away the hours, and what more can we ask for?I'd also like to pose a (somewhat rhetorical) question: what would be so bad about giving all players access to all cards right from the start, and charging a reasonable price to purchase the game?  Or, providing the player with an option to draw cards instead of taking an action, like Infinity Wars does?  Then, much more of your success or failure would rest on your own ingenuity rather than RNG and time/money spent just unlocking the ability to play the game, or getting screwed out of power or card draw.",0
16445,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewFun game overall. I'd call it a deeper Hearthstone for lack of anything more original.The one major flaw, and it's a big one, is what prevents me from recommending this game. The resource system is terrible and incredibly binary.  Way too many times I've had games where I've been mana screwed or flooded. Not an insurmountable fix to this either, but until that's done I don't think I'd care to throw any money at the game.Here's hoping that the devs use the EA time wisely.",0
16446,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThere's supposedly a lot of cards, but most serve little purpose outside draft.  Bold Adventurer?  Horned Vorlunk?  Any number of other cards are just worse than utility rares and legendries that have lower costs, superior abilities &c.  As to cards like Dormant Sentinel or similar high power cost cards, they don't serve much purpose outside draft, as even though they have good stats, any decent opposing deck will make key plays long before 7-drop becomes relevant.  I'd guess you could chop at *least* 25% of cards without impacting 85% of players in ranked or gauntlet modes (with the 15% exception being those players that are basically just starting out and need cards of any kind to fill out decks).Pros:  Not as grindy as Shadowverse, not as buggy as most Magic: the Gathering online releases, not as simplistic as Hearthstone, not as pushed-into-playing-the-market as Hex, has graduated design allowing players to amass commons and uncommons, then rares, without paying in (though they *will* have to grind)Cons:  Apart from the obvious ""grind"" and players without utility rares/legendaries being second class citizens - neither of which I consider *terrible* considering design aspects that compensate for each of those to *some* degree - what it comes down to for me is the game just doesn't have anything to offer apart from what it *does* offer.  It's sort of like going to a buffet and everything you see is pretty well made, but there's only five selections.  You just feel like something's missing.",0
16447,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI tend not to write reviews as I don't think it's possible to be objective unless you do it for a living, but I will say that this game really shines in a free to play but pay to win market. I nabbed it out of boredom on a bit of time off from work expecting to play for a few hours before I got hit with a soft cap where I would have to invest money to have any resemblance of not stagnating.Pleasantly surprised at how much the game rewards me. Getting a lot of cards from just going vs the AI which is great to see. There is a second campaign that rewards a new set of cards but costs a loooot of in game currency or the equivalent of about 8 euros. The cards it rewards seem just as balanced as the standard set and are definitely not in the realm of ""oh well if I dont have those I'm ♥♥♥♥ed"".I spent just under a tenner in the in game store more out of a thank you for the amount of hours enjoyment I got from the game thus far. Fair play to the devs to be honest.",1
16448,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewSo I never actually thought I'd like an online card game. I was always looking at it that that fun of playing a card game is intrinsically tied to talking to the person across the table from you, at least for me. If only so you can explain whatever insane and janky brew you put together.But with the game being free, I decided to give this one a shot, and it's absolutely wonderful. This is the recommendation of someone who used to play Magic: The Gathering, but hasn't really had the time to pursue it since graduating highschool, and who really, truely loves building interesting decks: I love this game after only a few hours, and I have no reason to believe it's going to drop off. I'm super psyched to play more of this, this game is sweet. Edit: Having thrown a few more hours in, there have been more peaks and valleys, but I did brew one janky deck that got me laughing manaically for a full minute that the thing weven won games, which was a blast. Still having a great time.Matches seem as fun and interesting as good Magic games, there's a pretty robust setup to play against AI if you aren't as interested in competetive play, and the UI is clean and slick and polished.The Buisness model, as you should be looking at that in any free-to-play game, seems like the most benelovent version of standard CCG nonsense that you can ask for without allowing for a secondary market. I haven't put money in yet, and I already have access to enough cards that I'm having fun brewing decks, and because they let you keep cards from drafts, I can improve my collection *by* playing fun games. (Okay, I hate draft, but I'm reasonably certain that's a problem on my end, not the game's.)I'm happy I got into this instead of Hearthstone, let's put it that bluntly. If you're lookin' for a card game, dive into this one  for a bit and see if it's what you want. Worst case, you play around, spend nothing, and go elsewhere.",1

16451,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewVery slick card game that sits in complexity between Hearthstone and Spellweaver. What I appreciate most about it is the refined interface that allows you to play quickly without waiting for animations to finish, and to have access to all info you need about the various card effects.The MTG-inspired battle mechanics are pretty good, as is the Instant system which allows you to react to enemy instants, stacking effects until one player stops replying - the only thing I sometimes wish for in Spellweaver, though that's definitely a tradeoff that will slow the game down when facing some players.The number of game modes available is also laudable, everything from gauntlet vs the AI to Ranked, to Draft.This said compared to Spellweaver or Hex I find browsing the card collection quite yawn-inducing. The effects on most cards are not very inspiring to say the least, they don't fire my imagination about potential synergies and combos like the former games do.In the end I'm recommending it as ""fast food"": it's easy to get into, they even give you pre-made decks regularly so you can just jump in without knowing a thing about deckbuilding, and you'll already be playing something more interesting than starter decks.",1
16452,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,Early Access ReviewSo far so good. Solid looking Hearthstone competator. Love the dual faction system. Like Elder Scrolls Legends and Hearthstone had a baby. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys95snj19ew ,1
16453,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIt's so close to being great.But it's not.I recently picked up Eternal because I have been frustrated with the currently broken Shadowverse meta, and lack of interest in Hearthstone. I could tell right off the bat in the tutorial missions that mana would be a huge frustration. And I was right.There is a reason the most popular card games on the planet don't use mana cards. Mana cards suck. They suck alot.Game after game you will either be begging to draw more mana, or begging to stop drawing so much mana. You will be frustrated almost every single game, and it marrs the entire experience. The cards are awesome and the game has a fantastic overall design, and it's almost utterly ruined by mana cards.It's an outdated and terrible mechanic. If they switched to a resource generation system the game would be a thousand times better. As it stands I can't in good conscious recommend this game to anyone.",0

16455,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access ReviewGame has been somewhat fun but the mana / flood problems make you feel like one out of every 5 games is just down to pure luck and some games are just non-playable due to a huge RNG due to:Deck size is too large 75 cards + the mandatory 25 power cards = wild card swingsThe mulligans are stupid crazy...... your 1st hand can be 1 power = automatic mulligan into 2 power cards followed by the next 5 cards of no power cards thus = automatic lossMaybe if they fixed the power cards / mulligan it would feel like more strategy but a lot of my wins / losses are just feeling like one person got mana screwed while the other did not.So rare to have a good close game it's just silly to think it's strategy at this point. ,0
16456,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game revolves around playing one or two cards your opponent can't interact with, and snowballing from there. Pretty boring to be honest.

16457,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is really frustrating for me.  I like the mechanics and card abilities but I hate the mana requirements on cards and the amount of times you or your opponent gets mana screwed.  It feels like at least 70% of games become top deck wars and/or mana screwed for one person.  Winning against someone that has 3 mana while you have 8+ or vice versa doesn't feel good to me and I just find it too big of a flaw to recommend this game to other people.,0
16458,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis should be an example of how one small design choice can ruin a game. This game has amazing card design. There are tons of ways to build decks and plenty of cards that were thrilling to open and play. Eternal has the best drafting experience on the digital CCG market, hands down. The reason I can't recommend this game is because the standard format is 75 cards.  If you have played any Magic the Gathering, playing ranked is like playing a game of EDH/Commander. It exaggerates the problem of mana flooding and screwing, and most games end up being very one-sided. Hearthstone, for example, has totally removed this experience from their game. Eternal just can't compete in a ranked experience, but if you like drafting, give it a shot.",0
16459,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewOf all of the recently made card games, this one is by far the worst in terms of anger-inducing mechanics.  The key to victory in at least 50% of the games I play is being the player that doesn't get mana-screwed.  This leaves victory feeling hollow (I won because my opponent couldn't play anything) and defeat feeling frustrating (I had an answer to that card in my hand but I couldn't play it).

It is possible to interact with cards and actions the opponent does in his turn but it is minimized in a way to have a good feeling about the game flow. It is not that it seems to always interrupt with every action you can take.It is possible to play ALL the game provides without paying any money or invest hundrets of hours to get free gold.After 2-3 days it is possible to build a free 2 play deck that is competetive enough for the lower ranks.One thing that has to be mentioned negativ is the force to play the complete campaign (aka. kind of tutorial), which takes several hours to get the basic decks of each color and before it is possible to play gauntlets.Long story short: a very good online game for every mtg player.",1
16478,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewDon't expect any enjoyable PvE after the first few hours.  You rank up quickly and then the AI's flawless card drawing advantage ruins your games and can deplete your coins.Problem #1: CPU Draw vs. Your DrawThe ""mana"" mechanic in Eternal works like Magic TG.  There are land/mana cards called sigils which cumulatively power your other cards each turn, and getting the right balance of mana is essential.  That's no problem except that in Eternal, the AI consistently (very infuriatingly consistent) gets a perfect balance of mana (sigils) vs. the other card types for smooth gameplay.  You, on the other hand, will contrast this by getting random draws, and you will consistently lack sigils.  Occasionally you will be overloaded with sigils instead, which is just as bad.  You may have the better deck, but it often doesn't help because the AI has a guaranteed draw every time.  This is especially problematic since PvE rewards require consecutive victories.I can't remember any other CCG working like this.  It seems the AI was intentionally programmed this way, perhaps to lure you into spending $$$ on better cards, to overcome this unreasonable advantage.  (It doesn't seem to happen in the bronze and silver leagues but you level out of those in a few hours.)Problem #2: Deck SizeThe minimum deck size is 75, process that.  (It's actually 50, but that doesn't include sigils, which  are added automatically, and bring the total to about 75.)  What?? This means you can't play themed decks very well at all.  Do you have a good idea for a deck, with clever card combos and synergies?  It will be too difficult to play it because it's too difficult to draw the right cards.Problem #3: GauntletAs you progress through the Gauntlet, you eventually reach Master league.  Nevermind the fact that each league is progressively harder yet the rewards stay the same, there is actually no special reward for a successful Master gauntlet run; just the same silver chest you get for minor accomplishments.  In fact, even beating the lesser leagues yields a better reward.  The highest PvE achievement in the game has no special reward, and it doesn't take long to advance and be stuck in that league.  (Assuming you have the patience to deal with aggravating mechanics to get there in the first place.)Problem #4: CampaignThe main campaign is incredibly short and you will be finished it in a few hours.  The second campaign costs quite a bit, and I still do not have enough saved despite having completed the highest level Gauntlet.  (~50 hours in)Problem #5: ForgeFun at first, but quickly becomes just another way to lose gold.  Thanks to the sigil problem detailed above, you just throw away your precious 2500 gold entry fee after reaching the Gold/Diamond+ league.  You need multiple consecutive wins to make this worth it, but that becomes very difficult when the game is withholding sigils.  This one is the nail in the coffin for PvE.  At least the Gauntlet, while frustrating, is free.  Gold is just too scarce to justify the high cost and risk of advanced Forge runs.ConclusionEither stick to PvP only, or uninstall and save yourself the trouble; or at least wait for updates to the problems above.  Maddening design choices ruin PvE fun after you level out of the beginner leagues.1/7 sigils.",0

16480,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewHaving played the game quite a while and many hours I'd say it is a fine free game. You can get far for free and earn the necessary gold to buy game modes (Forge/Draft) or boosters quickly.Anyway, make sure to be quite zen playing, as there are a couple of points that can get very annoying and have you quit the game for a while.- There is no way to contril your power cards for your decks, they are always added automatically de facto by the number of cards of the factions you added. So several classic game builds are not really possible. Doing a bi-color deck using 60% or more quick cheap spells of one color and boosting the rest with mighty cards of another faction? You'll never get the power needed to play the more expensive cards. You need to balance cheap/expensive cards within every faction.- Starting the game you have ONE redraw. Have a bad hand, no power or power only hand? Think twice if you redraw if you have at least two colors you need in the starting hand. Usually (with a high % chance) you'll find your redraw hand either one-color power stuck (2 power max) with either only expensive cards or cards of another color. You need to be lucky to draw them before you are done and dead, what leads to the next point:- The AI seems to always draw what he needs. If he can't get through on the floor he will just start to draw a flyer each turn. You finally get a good creature out while he's empty handed? The Kill-spell will follow the next turn, or at least a silence/stun - whatever suits better. You holding a spell killing a creature with 4 attack or higher? The AI will play in a completely weird way (not acting like ANY player would with his cards on the field) to NOT have any creature higher than 3. Example: 3x 1/1 critts giving him an advantage (card draw/boost/malus on my cards) and playing a 3/3 texting ''you may sacrifice another creature to give this unit +2/+2).... - Some cards are not really balanced and overpowered. Warcry and Void interaction are very powerful, as creatures dying keep all there boosts, so for 1 power you get them back to hand AND boosted a further 1/1. Nice for a cheapo 8/8 or more for investing 3 power :D Also Endurance is fine with the hourglass for 1 power. All your creatures can't be stunned or exhausted, and attack/defend every turn...Anyway it's a nice game and I like it, just needs some more balancing to harmonize the factions and maybe some of the game techniques and especially would really be fine to at least let the players set a % ratio for the power cards when building a deck.",1
16481,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewA breath of fresh air coming from Hearthstone. Easy to pick up, with a slightly more forgiving grind for cards. You probably won't start having fun until you spent ~$70-$100",1
16482,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewAs an ex mtg player and card game lover, I really do love the concept of this game. The game is set similair like that of magic where there are 5 colors which each do their own things to various extents. The game has a nice deck building feature which you can make decks or varying colors and see what little combos you can make. Which was the selling point for me for awhile. Such as the g/w legendary temple speaker and the w legendary acedant you can basically draw almost all of your deck out by simply shooting all your destiny lands out and drawing a card to replace the destiny land AND a card for ascendants empower. However the severe issue i have with this game is the lack of deck shuffling interactions there are, mainly because the biggest issue in this game is sigil screw (drawing all sigil or none for 4+ turns). Now some say that shuffling the deck wont matter as you can't see what's inside your deck or the order. Well that is true however magic players would know that shuffling is also a form of rearraging the deck to simply just change the odds in the deck as it stands, ie* When i go to draw a forest out i dont search the first forest but see clumps of lands and grab one from those. Except in this game when i play the 1 mana seek power, I get a sigil of my choice RANDOMLY from my deck, meaning it could be a mana from a clump of 5 or a land from my next draw. Which brings me back to the lack of deck interactions in the game, there is no way to shuffle your deck so once the game starts you are stuck with the order that the game shuffled it which tends to always have land clumps by the dozen of 2-4 lands meaning you could get 12 lands in 12 turns with no way of stopping it. Another thing is the fact of seeing what cards are in the deck through some spells does incur an imbalance of card knowledge, in g/r you can see the top card of your deck if you have buffed it, ie* warcry. Meaning if i play the 4 mana search a unit or weapon from my deck, I can see all my units and weapons. From there I can see which ever weapon or unit is buffed then that would be my next card to draw. So thus I would avoid picking that one and choose another, thereof affecting the entire game through an unfair advantage of knowing what is in your next draw. It is knowledge any other player wont have and due to the non-shuffling implement they get that card.So as much as i love the mechanics and deck design and card interactions, I can not get past this lack of deck shuffling mechanics. As it stands the most frustrating aspect of the game is the least worked on with no hopes in the future of ever being fixed. Perhaps if they change the deck shuffling feature the game could hold up hope but as of now is just another chernobly waiting to happen.   DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
16483,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI wanted to find a secondary card game next to Shadowverse for causal play. I had a lot of people recommend Eternal to me, so I gave it a try... and I'm honestly done with this after only about 2.5 hours. Now, as far as I understand the game is very similar to MtG in terms of mechanics. I never played MtG. Thanks to that I felt like a fish out of water right from the get go. The initial story mode serves as a tutorial. A very bad one. It tells you what to do, but rarely why and only go through mechanics that are baltantly obvious. I thought that I got an okay grasp on the game, so I jumped into the puzzle section, because people told me that mode is essentialy an advanced tutorial.I couldn't even finish the basic ones. I got increasingly frustrated, so I ended up looking up guides. And on like every second puzzle, I was like ""WAIT, you can do that?! Why the hell didn't the game bothered to tell me that?!"". Here's the thing: Eternal has possibly the worst tutorial I've ever seen. The idea of a tutorial is that first it explains the player what's what, then tests said player on what was just explained. Eternal skips the explaining part entirely and just throws the tests in front of you. You want to learn to swim? In the shark tank you go!By the time I finished the puzzles, I had enough of the game. I felt utterly lost, confused and lost all confidence in myself regarding the mechanics. So I went online and found a guide on the mechanics of the game. A 75 pages long PDF that is. And that was the point where just uninstalled this. If your game is so complicated that it needs an entire damn book to explain its mechanics, then have the decency to have a damn tutorial that isn't hot garbage!If you are an MtG veteran, you will probably like this. If you are looking for an alternative to Hearthstone, Shadowverse, etc. then keep looking.",0

16485,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewGood concept for a Card Game, but at the moment it doesn't work well because of power cards. Maybe they correct it in the future by adding some more ways to search and add power from your deck (like MTG does) and by removing the ""you need to have 1/3 of your deck as power cards"".I will update this review in the future when they send more patchs...***Cons***1#-> Every game is like getting tons of power cards or getting none. I lost the count of how many times I played 5 or more straight turns getting power cards or getting 1 or 2 in more than 10 turns... Because of this kind of thing you don't need to be a skilled player you just need to have a set of hat made of Four-leaf clovers and a rabbit's foot necklace.2#-> You have 90% trash cards and only 10% good cards that cost a huge amount of stones. It's absurd how crafting cost pass from 50 and 100 to 800 and 1600 stones... Maybe they could balance cards and by doing that reduce the crafting cost, would be better for the game itself because this would open more deck possibilities.3#-> ""You need to have 1/3 of your deck as power cards"", this limitation helps the 1# to get bigger.4#-> Because of the first three major cons, your deck options are reduced by control, aggro and midrange deck types (see tournament decks for more info), burn, earlygame and other types of decks are very cool and fun to play with, but your win rate will probably be lower than the 3 types I mentioned before because of 1#.5#-> They should implement some kind of matchmaking system for casual, I observed that basically the actual system is only.... Oh I found a player for you... there is no level or win / lose rate to balance this kind of thing, new players get destroyed by old players this way.6#-> Small problem, they created the new mode Puzzles, it's a very good mode but I feel that the rewards for this are very low comparing the other ones. Maybe they could add chests or more gold to it.***Pros***1#-> The campaign is pretty good, you can learn fast how the game works and how to make some basic decks.2#-> The other AI modes are very good too (Puzzles, Gauntlet, Forge). In puzzles you will have a good experience on how the card habilities should be used and you will need some smart moves to finish it. Gauntlet is kind of a mortal kombat tower, you will have to defeat all enemies to fight against one big boss with a hability that benefits his deck, but sometimes it can help you out too. Forge is like Gauntlet, but you will get a random pack of cards and you will have to create a deck from it and use it until the end (this mode you need to spend some gold or real money to play).3#-> Casual Ranked and Draft are cool to play too, but for casual they should 5#.4#-> Animations and game design are great in my opinion, they didn't put a lot of effects in cards so you can play this game in many devices (pcs,laptops,tablets...), you don't need to have a good pc to play it. The only thing I think they should do is to improve the interaction player and field as Blizzard did in Heartstone (in this game you only interact with the totems).5#-> F2P with amazing rewards. You don't need to spend tons of money to get good cards, you can farm them by playing the game (will take a huge amount of time, but still not a P2W game).6#-> Very good crafting system (only the cost is a little unbalanced) and search engine. Very easy to use and search. You can make how many decks you want and keep testing them in the AI modes or casual.7#-> Good store, there is not many things to buy yet, but it's very nice to look at it and as I said in 5# not a P2W game,  you can buy thing with gold and for real money, most of things are cosmetic.-------------Obs: I still need to play ranked to test it and try to invite some friends to test if there is a possibility to create or play in a room against them. (later I will do that and update this review).-------------Conclusion: Very Good F2P game, but I can't recommend it yet because of 1#, 2# and 3# Major Cons. I will change to recommended as soon they fix and balance more the game (I'm have a good feeling about the next patchs).",0

16487,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewTLDR: One of the best card games out there. Not recommended due to flawed (apparently unfixable) core mana/power mechanic.Comparisons to MtG and Hearthstone barely do it justice. While it drew inspiration from the two, the varied mechanics make every faction/color fight on equal footing. From aggro to midrange, or even late game mammoth decks, they all clash for a piece of the pie.Well, the same is valid for every card game! What makes this one special?The sheer feel of power your cards give. Compared to any other CCG, the strength of these cards is absurd. The feed-back you get from your deck (when you win) is that you stomped the opponent, even if the game was close. While losing has the reverse effect, the game doesn't let you dwell on the past. Rewards are given with every occasion: single player campaigns, AI games, first win of the day, and so on. You’ll have to keep your aspirations to a top tier place in check tough. Getting a decent collection still requires investment (time and/or money), as in every CCG.Other players have said more positives about the game than I could write in a limited space.As such, I will focus on why I gave it a negative mark.Like MtG, it suffers from power fixing issues: you either get too much or too little (mana/power flood or screw). They mended the algorithm several times, and yet, it is far from working. I won’t quote other players or streamers; suffice to say the issue is real. The amount of games lost due to mana/power issues is enough to make the grind tiring and unpleasant. As strange as it sounds, it’s even sadder when the opponent has it. Adding these losses up, you end up with a simple question: why isn’t there anything being done? Well, there is. Maybe. The communications regarding the issue is minimal. For me, the bigger question is why they chose the classical (MtG) style of mana/power fixing knowing the flaw it has. More so considering some of the main developers are former MtG players.The game is beautiful: fun mechanics, captivating games, great feed-back and rewards. But all of it is diminished to a zero line by its flawed core mechanic: mana/power fixing. A flaw I don’t believe will ever be fixed.Prove me wrong.",0

That being said, the game introduced many cards incouraging 'aggro' play which doesn't need to ramp but just kill your opponent in 4 turns. The heavyness of the rng that punishes intelligent and strategic gameplay and rewards mindless vanilla idiots.not recommended for sanity reasons, play hearthstone or something.",0
16490,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game has a lot of potential, but it hamstrings itself with a series of deck-building rules that I struggle to see as anything other than a cash-grab.  I'll lay it out short and sweet: You get cards by playing the two Draft modes, either against AI for 2500 gold or against players for 5000 gold.  In order to get gold to play draft modes, you either play ranked matches (slow) or play against AI (fast if you win reliably).  The AI only pays off if you can reliably win 7 games.Now here's the problem: your deck is unplayable unless it consists of 33% mana and a minimum of 75 cards, or 50 cards and 25 mana.  That's a large enough percentage that you /will/ run in to situations where you get mana starved or mana flooded - either you have a hand with 3 mana and all your cards cost 4+ to cast or you have a fistful of mana and nothing else.  Now, will this happen every game?  Of course not!  A well-balanced deck with a good mix of cards will only be left helpless at the mercy of RNG occasionally.  However, anecdotally, it feels like it happens at least once every 7 games, and there's no option to design your deck in such a way that you can eliminate this problem and get more reliable results.  Sometimes you just draw 6 mana sources from turns 15 through 21 and watch yourself lose the game despite playing to the best of your ability, and the frustration when that happens on game 7 of a Gauntlet run spoils the rest of the gameplay.  This enforced lack of reliability in a mode that dangles rewards over your head for winning consistently is a bad gameplay experience.  It feels designed to tease people with the possibility of getting better cards without actually offering a realistic chance of doing so.  This is the hook in Eternal's ""free to play"" model - sure, you can play the game for free, if you're the sort of fortunate soul who can make a profit by buying boxes of magic cards and selling the foils for more than the cost of the box.",0

Nothing worse than losing a game because you got to 10 power turn 5 or 6 and all you draw is mana for 8 straight turns, or your hand is full of 8 drops and you're stuck at 2 mana.

16495,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThe most recent expansion has made making budget decks next to impossible. You can still climb and reach master as a new player, but expect to be beat up by players with much better collections regularly. Aggro is dead, and the devs seem to be fine with letting it die. Any time a combo deck becomes usable it gets nerfed to oblivion. Midrange seems to be the playstyle that the devs push the most, but now it takes 16+ copies of legendaries to build a competitive deck. Control is probably the best thing this game has to offer, especially with the new merchants, but you should still expect to need at least 8 legendaries to make a competitive deck.In short, this game is no longer a better ftp game than other ftp card games and the meta is heavily skewed toward slow matches.If you have to play a MTG style game, its still better than MTG Arena and MTGO.",0
16496,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe shuffler is goddamn unreal - seriously, one of the worst I've ever seen. 4 copies of the same card in a row are the norm, as well as constant mana problems (regardless of the manabase).

That ONE hand is sure going to get rerolled as leaning on luck to do anything past the first turn isn't a good idea at all.Which leads to the randomness.Huge deck sizes and pure random make any deck you have fairly meaningless.Each battle may as well be won by rolling dice and waiting about ten minutes.It's a giant time sink to be sure, so if you do enjoy games that suck time away then by all means.However, the time invested doesn't translate too well into cards earned.So you won't feasibly get to be top dog by being a free-to-play player.If you do decide to give the game a go, then I do recommend merely conceeding the game if you see anyone with the green bird totem- these people have put money into the game and their cards are pretty much guaranteed to be better than what you have.",0
16498,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is a much better game IMO than Hearthstone, ESL, or many other digital card games out there.  It is simpler than MTG but keeps many of the same rules that are abandoned by more recent card games such as playing mana and instants.  Unfortunately it has already fallen into the problems that led me to quit Hearthstone long ago-- the fact that there are very rare patches and balance changes.  In the past 3-4 months there have only been a handful of new cards and only a couple small balance changes.  In the current age of sharing decks online, this philosophy leads to extremely stale matches against many similar decks.  I think this could be a great game if the developers took a more liberal approach to making changes in the game, but at this point even if they did, the playerbase has dwindled significantly since it released in early access.",0

Some of them run placeholders but the number of cards played versus the amount of cards that exist (and can be easily aquired for free - i grant you that) is far from perfect.I will reconsider this review when:- The power level difference between cards and/or the aquisition rate improves (yes you get many cards but most of them get dusted anyways and the exchange rate is worse than any other major CCG has)- Matchmaking improves meaning you dont face a 30%+ legendary deck with yours that barely has 4 of themIn it's current form simply cannot recommend this game to newcomers.

16503,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI paid about 100 USD and climbed to GOLD rank in two weeks, with the win rate of 70% or so, but decided to quit because the game play is not fun.Pros:It is fun to brew your own deck if you are rich enough to build sufficient card collections. The cards that utilize the void (used spells and dead creatures pool) and those that manipulate the deck (like warcry giving +1 +1 to the next card you draw) create a significantly greater space for deck varieties.Cons:The playing itself is very dull and RNG heavy and frustrating.If you don't draw the right combination of powers (mana) in the first few turns, you can't play any cards and just watch your opponent beat you up.If both players manage to draw the right powers, then the match is decided based on who got to draw more threats and answers. If the opponent plays Tavrod for 2 turns and you only have 1 removal, you lose.If the opponent is aggro and you don't have lightning storm (aoe removal) by turn 3, you lose.If the opponent is chalice (a weapon that buffs small creature and draw you card) and you can't burn him in the first few turns, you lose.If your deck is based on reanimating the void and the opponent just happens to play a ""Steward of the Past,"" which retroactively silences everything in your void on top of having a good stats on its own, you lose.At the mulligan phase, you have absolutely no information on what kind of deck the opponent is playing, so you just blindly mulligan for powers. In Hearthstone you know the opponent's class so you can make an educated guess as to what cards will be effective. In Eternal you never know if you should keep the Lightning Storm.Matches are very snow-bally, one sided and RNG. I feel whatever I do or the opponent does have no bearing on the outcome.  You can try and play for free.But be warned when you have enough cards to build an optimized deck, when your threats demand answers and you can include as many hard removals as the meta calls, then the game has become a dice roll.I will come back only if they change the power system.",0
16504,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewSo I'm actually enjoying this game, or rather I should say I really WANT to. Doesn't seem pay to win (Keep in mind I only have 2 hours played.) I finished the campaign (Sometimes losing pointlessly because I couldn't draw sigils) and did my first gauntlet run, I was excited to see what this gamemode would be, the idea of playing to win better rewards to meet an ultimate boss and get the final tier prize was enticing, anyway, I lost my first match instantly and that ended my run because I drew no sigils.. Ok so by now I've unlocked ranked play, being a veteran Hearthstone player I choose to create a mid/lategame red/green focused deck and jump into ranked, lose my first two matches because I only draw 1-2 sigils. (GREAT) I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off, but after I believe my first match I get a premade deck (provided to me by the game) for playing a ranked match. GREAT. Seems like a good and balanced deck, earlygame focused but with control aspects and cards that provide you with sigils. AWESOME. Maybe this will solve my problem of sigils lacking eh? (By this moment I'm severely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at RNG) I go on to play 2 matches with this deck and lose both times because I CAN'T FOR THE LOVE OF ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ING DRAW SIGILS.(Anyway :]) I go on to play my last placement match for ranked with the premade Justice deck which I have had luck in the campaign with, (I also enjoyed the aggressive creature focus playstyle of it) Needless to say, the earlygame went great I drew 3 sigils of justice and played them, this got me a HUGE lead in the earlygame. I continue to press my opponent, he is at around 2 health (However through the entire game I have not drawn a single sigil.. and drew cards which cost 4-6 'power'{this game's mana currency}) At this moment my enemy has 8 sigils/power and whilst I am overdrawing on cards because I can play nothing, he is reactively playing and actually engaging with the game. He drops a legendary and basically pounds me into oblivion from 2hp because I legitimately can't play the game.I have never experienced more consistent bad RNG in the game, the game needs a SERIOUS bad luck protection system, or provide a better more concrete way of drawing & playing sigils (just realised I haven't explained what those are, they are a prerequisite for playing 'alligned' cards in this game, like Magic's 'lands') It's a disgusting feeling having to concede games in campaign because you realise in the 3rd-4th turn you are going to lose. And then go on to ranked multiplayer and realise you can't concede or you lose rank, play and get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off because you redrew your starting hand into the minimum amount of sigils 5 times in a row, and you draw no more AND YOU CAN DO NOTHING FOR THE ENTIRE GAME.Obviously my opponents did not experience the same bad luck, so this might just be me, or the strongest decks are those build around 1 sigil requirements & card draw/1 power cost cards :).But this might just be me being extremely unlucky, so take my review with a healthy proportion of salt (If you think I haven't provided enough)",0

16508,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI played magic the gather about 15-20 years ago with a couple friends. Never got in to it because I wasn’t going to spend an absurd amount on cards.  Saw this, hey its free and thought I’d give it a try.From the free perspective the local content is pretty easy going. Cards and how everything works isn’t too difficult to understand, even for someone like myself that hasn’t had the opportunity to play these kinds of games much. The causal games against other players is also rewarding.  You start seeing some ingenuity and coming up with your own as well. Makes things interesting.  Once you start ranked games I did pretty poorly. Some of it was luck of the draw and of course bad discussions due to lack of experience no doubt. The complexity of the cards and people playing multiple races/color decks makes the things more difficult to understand. An example of this if you an enemy unit card 2-2 and yours is 2-3 you know your unit will win so you would choose to attack or defend with it. After you executed that action cards come in to play to buff their unit or hurt your unit and you lose your card without you knowing going in.  Course the same could be said for the other team, just know going in your going to need to practice and gain experience. I played for quite a while, had a good time.  I have like 5k of gold but there seems no where to spend it. To advance from here and get better cards and build decks it appears it’s pay to win on the ranked side of things.If your looking for something casual and free the causal games this is a good pick. Good replay value, I’ll no doubt enjoy revisiting playing casual games.  If they implemented a system to be able to grind the cards and deck, such as being able to use the gold you get from winning then I could see my self playing a great deal more.  I’d do a one-time payment to “buy the game” to gain access to everything everyone else has. If you’re not in to microtransaction and play to win the scope of how far you can go is pretty limited. But you can obtain casual entertainment out of it, for free.  My motto is, if its free, it’s for me!  ",1

If you are a twitch prime member you also get a nice infusion of card packs (as of 9/1/18)  which is very helpful!  I ended up buying gems for the campaign chapters, which I normally pay for in any card games I play online, but, it looks like you can grind gold to pay for them as well!Rng can be frustrating at times, giving you only resource cards, and then giving you no resource cards, while giving you only one mulligan...but, such is life eh?

16515,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI really, really want to like this game. If it weren't for a glaring issue, glaring so brightly the devs apparently can't see it, I would heartily recommend it.The issue is the mechanics around mulligans, draws and power/influence. Essentially, at least 25% of the time, the game will be over before you have a playable hand. Since your opponent is in the same position, that means half of games are decided not by the quality of your deck, your play or interactions, but by the game ♥♥♥♥ing you or your opponent over before one of you even gets a chance. That's worse than Hearthstone.The games where you do actually get to play meaningfully can be quite good, so it has that going for it.Edit: with the latest patches, even the games where you don't get mana screwed are now utter♥♥♥♥♥♥In a naked attempt to over-monetise, they introduce a massively and obviously overpowered card, and have since refused to nerf it, leading to basically every deck being a removal pile.

16516,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI recommend trying but not investing very much time or money in this flawed product.Good game but the shuffling algorithm is absolute trash. You WILL get games where you don’t draw any mana at all for multiple turns no matter how many you have in the deck. The response from most people is “that’s variance and it’s good for the game”. The problem is this happens WAY too often, as in frustratingly often. It happens so often I have contemplated uninstalling the game multiple times. However, I have the sunken costs fallacy in full effect, I have spent money and time so I don’t want to see a waste in my investment. I suffer on but quit my session shortly after starting due to these failures almost every time, frustrated in such wasted potential from an otherwise fun game.I would recommend people try this game but with the deck variance being so extreme compiled with a clearly terrible shuffling algorithm you will get a VERY large amount of non-games (games with no mana for you or the opponent, equaling an automatic loss for that party).",0
16517,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewAt it's current state I wouldn't recommend this game for anyone but Free-to-play players with a lot of free time.  If you're a paying customer the Legendary cards which you can have 4 of in a deck is difficult to collect.  Especially with less free time to play.  They tout guaranteed 3 legendaries for every ""box = 32 packs"" which is normally all you're going to get.  It's ridiculous in a game where you need 4 of said legendaries.  I've purchased quite a few boxes and rarely have I ever got anything more than that.  Unless you're fine just playing one deck for a long time it's an awful system.Also, this game is similar to Magic The Gathering in it's mana/lands for resource.  Which doesn't really translate well in a online card game.  When I can go 5 games in a row being mana starved playing 25 power in a deck plus 4 x of Seek Power spell that lets me find one is equally ridiculous.

16518,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter recent developments, I no longer recommend this game or this developer to anyone.EDIT: Since the developer chose to chime in with a BS reply: Spyware, by definition: ""Spyware is software that aims to gather information about a person or organization without their knowledge, that may send such information to another entity without the consumer's consent, or that asserts control over a device without the consumer's knowledge.""RedShell is literally software that aims to gather information about us as consumers without our knowledge. It collects information from browsing history to note if that user has seen or engaged with their advertising efforts to check for their efficacy. That information is then sent to another entity (the developer) without the consumer's consent.RedShell fits perfectly into the definition. The developer is arguing this isn't the case because there is no 'personal' information... Even if it is the case that there is no way to reverse engineer the source (which seems to be a dubious proposition that RedShell merely recommends, not enforces), that doesn't matter. Any data collected via software with no consent and without one's knowledge qualifies as Spyware, and RedShell is that. Our spending habits, our advertisement engagement, that's our data that we own. It has value. If they want it, they can either pay us for it or do the ethical thing and just ask. That's all it takes. A quick pop up, ""Hey, can we gather anonymous system information to help us determine how to best advertise our game and expand our outreach? It would really help us expand the community!"", ""Why of course, game that I like, have followed, and want to see flourish. I'd be more than happy to help out in my small way.""But no, instead of that, we get a BS response like below doing whatever they can to deflect any guilt after getting caught with their hand in the cookie jar. My original review above remains, and if anything, should be hardened further.Let me also add that I am not just some random person looking to insult the game. I am someone who spent a good bit of money on this game and who was invested in its future. I might not have crazy playtime here on Steam, but that's because I used it mostly on mobile.",0
16519,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you're looking for a free to play card game that combines the best features of other franchises into one simple and elegant package with tonnes of strategic variation and depth, you've come to the right place.When you start playing this game, 3 things hit you immediately:1- The animation is fast and fluid. No time is wasted on flashy nonsense. The animations goes through quickly with minimal interruption, and still looks good! So most of your time is spent making decisions rather than impatiently watching stuff happen on screen.2- If you're familiar with Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering, then this game feels instantly familiar and easy to learn.It doesn't suffer from the RNG self-destruction vomit that Hearthstone has become.And it has a much more modern online client interface than the outdated relic of MtG online.3- Despite being in early access, it already has so much content. And even without having a full library of legendary cards, you have sooo many options in deck construction, strategy and interaction without paying a single dime.I was so impressed with the elegant design of all the cards and in-game interface that I bought some of the in-game currency just to support the developers. But I did not need it! You can earn and craft all the cards by playing very casually.There are several modes to play:1- Gauntlet: Against AI decks. Here you can test your new deck concepts and do some casual grinding for Gold. Extremely useful. And surprisingly challenging.2- Forge: Also against AI. This is basically Arena or Draft but against AI. It costs half as much Gold to enter than with Draft, and the Draft itself is cheap anyways. Forge is good if you love Draft/Arena gameplay but don't like to wait for other players or don't like competitive play too much.3- Draft: You open a pack and pick one card. Then you pass it on to someone else, and you pick another card from a pack passed by someone else etc.... until the pack is empty. And then you repeat the process for a total of 4 times.Then you construct a deck from the cards you picked and play PVP. If you enjoy the competition and have the brains to stay competitive, this mode can earn you A LOT of gold, packs and Shiftstone (used to craft cards). Best of all, you keep the cards that you picked! including the ones you did not use to make your deck.4- Ranked: PVP Just like constructed in hearthstone. Nothing special. I actually prefer constructed over Draft due to the incredible creativity of the community. But that's just a personal preference. I like to test new concepts cuz it's so much fun.Casual: PVP but without rank points. Useful if you just want to enjoy the gameplay and complete quests without affecting your current rank.5- Events: Every now and then, we get an event with special rules. I really like these because they make you THINK and build your decks in specific ways to capitalise on the battlefield conditions. Plus, they are incredibly rewarding, so it's worth the effort.In addition, there are quests that require you to play certain colors or card types to unlock chests. This encourages you to get creative and try new things. Just the usual card game incentives...I've seen most reviews and Steam discussions complaining about the resource system (mana) borrowed from Magic The Gathering. Indeed, you have to play Sigils (lands) to gain power (mana) and play your cards.Truth be told, the number of spells that draw Sigils are somewhat limited. MtG had many more mana fetching and fixing cards. In Eternal you need to give extra attention to include enough Sigil fetching cards in your decks. Seek Power and Find the Way are EXTREMELY important. And card draw engines are a MUST HAVE in every deck strategy. Otherwise you will be at the mercy of top decks by turn 7.If you can get accustomed to the mana system and start brainstorming deck ideas, you're gonna LOVE this game, especially if you like to be creative.If you can't be bothered, feel free to net deck. Many new players net deck at first. In fact, the community is very generous and intelligent. And they love to share their ideas with new players.Whatever your playstyle is, there is a deck for you. Feel free to experiment. You'll be surprised by the magnitude of unlikely synergies you can discover. It's very enjoyable to have this EUREKA!! moment when testing new combos. Eternal really encourages you to try new cards.There are a few slightly overused or unbalanced cards, but most of them are cheap to craft and everything can be easily countered with the right strategy. The Silence mechanic is particularly powerful and almost essential to counter certain effects. I'm a little worried about the Silence tbh, and I really hope they add a Revert mechanic similar to Hex: Shards of Fate. Otherwise, Silence effects would have to be deliberately kept few in number from now on because it's counter-interactive and not very fun.As far as card games go, I give this a solid 7/10.If the devs keep an eye out on card balance and maintain their caution when releasing new cards, this game will be an excellent addition to any card game player's library, especially if you're tired of the old franchises that have become overburdened with their outdated online clients.Try it and keep an open mind. You won't be disappointed.",1

16528,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewRecently got sick of Hearthstone. Tried Eternal, great game! Very similar to MTG and exactly what I was looking for. Better than MTGO, Hex and Hearthstone IMO. Give it a try!Cannot wait until set 2.",1
16529,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewFinally!  Eternal Card Game is the game Wizards of the Coast should have created 10 years ago.  Had Wizards created an accessible, attractive and intuitive OCCG based on MTG, they would be the dominant player in the market going on a decade now.  However, their short-sightedness and unwillingness to experiment with  their IP means we had to wait for Eternal to scratch our Magic itch.  (Hex, while a beautiful and intricate game, lacks the 'accessible' and 'intuitive' aspects that Hearthstone and Eternal meet)+++ The gameplay in Eternal is rock-solid, taking core CCG mechanics and tying them to colors similar to MTG.    Currently the colors are not as stratified as MTG, which allows for more versatile single color decks, while offering expanded options for multi-colored decks.  Eternal (after my 10 hours of play or so, so take it with a grain of salt) seems less focused on defining the metagame itself, unlike Hearthstone (and to some extent MTG), where the meta (minus minor tweaking) is established within days of a new set coming out, largely by the developer.  This is for 2 reasons; the core mechanics introduced in Hearthstone expansions are usually the most efficient (Jades, Single-copy bombs like Reno and Kazakus, etc), and the limited card pool simply doesn't allow much experimentation.  Although I'm just starting with Eternal it appears that there is a decent range of creature removal, larger creatures and the like in each color, along with some strong (but not 'forced') themes like Echo and void-play.++ While Eternal has a mana mechanic, it is automated. This means the game sets your mana curve for you, limiting your optimal mana ratios.  However, I assume they did it to remove complexity from deck-building, which is a good thing when trying to bring in more casual players.  The game offers a plethora of mana-fixing cards as well, in both colorless and colored cards, to allow better control of your mana-flow.  So far, I've only been mana-hosed on a couple of occasions...in most games mana has tended to be plentiful, often to the point of excess (as my early games tend to go long while I build my collection and create more efficient decks).+++ Eternal thankfully does away with the tiny card packs of Hearthstone and Hex and has 12 cards per pack, very close to the 14 (minus the land) in a MTG pack.  At $1/pack, not counting the ability to draft, guantlet or forge for free cards/dust, the pack size/value ratio is exceptional compared to Hex, MTGO and Hearthstone.Currently, the game modes available are Gauntlet, Forge, Ranked and Draft.  As someone who likes to play mostly solo as I build a collection, the game modes are very close to perfect.    Gauntlet is a free PVE constructed tournament mode and can be used to grind gold and some (usually common or uncommon) cards, with a perfect 7-win record earning a card pack as well.   The AI modes seem well-designed to offer players good rewards as  the player base could probably not accommodate PVP in each.Forge is Eternal's Arena, a sealed-deck format where you build a deck from random sets of 3 cards; again, the game assigns your Mana.  It appears (though I've only played once (but did get a perfect 7 wins)) that once you have chosen 2 colors of cards, all remaining picks are of those 2 colors.  This is a very nice feature and prevents someone from getting pretty far off-track into 5 colors (though I am certain there are some who would actually like that).  Arena's cost 2500 gold to enter; the 7-win run earned me 3500 gold, a couple of cards, and 4 card packs, so a little more than 3-1 value.  You are allowed 2 losses before your run ends; as you are playing an AI, it seems this mode offers a pretty fair chance to hit 7 wins if you are good at sealed in CCG's.  If the decks the AI is playing don't get more challenging as you rank up in Forge, it should be pretty easy to go infinite.I've only played a few games of Ranked, just enough to get a win for a quest, as I doubt I'm prepared to face constructed decks quite yet.  The mode works fine, and even with only about 2k players online at any time, the matchmaking only took a little longer than Hearthstone's.  The 'Casual' mode is currently offline, I am guessing until a larger player base means it won't cause extended queue times.  I haven't drafted yet, but I will update my review when I do.Overall, Eternal is a great entry to the crowded online CCG market, and outside of Hearthstone, might be the one to succeed with players who want something a little deeper than Blizzard's game.  The nitpicks I have with the game are minor...I think the art looks a little small on the play table (and I'm on a 27"" monitor), though it is fine when zoomed in.  As a once-upon-a-time competitive Magic player that quit mainly due to mana randomness, I prefer a Hearthstone-style consistently building mana pool.  However, it's not a game-breaker and I haven't noticed it being as much of a problem as I had in my PTQ-qualifier days.  If you are a Magic player that wants deeper mechanics, but still slicked-up Hearthstone-style experience, Eternal is your game.",1

16531,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewGood game, but has the same problem as MTG, land(power) cards are like internal sick u can hardly avoid.I know it is all about resources management, but why bring the pain that all players will have to suffer from?(don't tell me that people who build a deck with all power cards will not =_=) If u think it is ok, then this game might suit u, but to me, i would aviod any kind of games like MTG(this game, Hex etc.).",0
16532,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI love this game. The fact that you keep every card you use in Draft and Forge makes it worth buying into them, whether with gold or real cash. It is so easy to earn gold in this game - I'm already halfway to earning enough to buy Jekk's Bounty without ever putting a cent into the game itself.",1
16533,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal is an enjoyable Collectible Card Game, more strategic than Hearthstone and less complex than Magic.  It can be played completely free - every card in the game is available and can be obtained simply by playing the game, and the rewards for daily quests, completing game modes, and climbing the ranked ladder are extremely generous; one can obtain several booster a packs a day without paying any real world money (although supporting the devs with a gem purchase is also generously rewarded).The gameplay has a satisfying level of strategic choice without being overly complex.  Since the minimum deck size is 75 cards, to be competitive a good amount of thought must go into deck composition (your ""brew"").  In game, when an opponent casts a spell or attacks, there is an opportunity to respond with your own ""fast spells"", which gives an aspect of interactivity that Hearthstone lacks.  There are no ""activated abilities"" and ""fast spells"" can only be cast at certain designated points, not possibly after every action  as in Magic or Hex which means this game is less complex tha those, but since there are fewer ""change of focus"" points the games tend to be much smoother and take considerably less time to complete.  a 15 minute game would be a long one, with most games averaging 10 minutes or less.Don't be misled by the lackluster title - I would highly recommend this game, and also throwing developer Dire Wolf Digital a few dollars in gem purchases as a reward for an excellent product and an incentive to keep adding expansions.",1
16534,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is the perfect blend of Hearthstone, Magic, and Hex. It has the easy accessibility of Hearthstone and simple controls/visuals, the deeper strategy and complexity of Magic, and the mana/influence system from Hex which makes for a much quicker moving game than Magic.

16535,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI've been searching for a digital card game that has the depth of Magic with the slick interface of Hearthstone, and a focus on drafting.  This is a tall order, but ontop of that I also demand an economy that isn't P2W, isn't overly grindy, and doesn't punish me for wanting to play long sessions if I'm in the mood.I am now suspicious that the Eternal devs are monitoring me via hidden camera, because Eternal hits all my criteria head on.The only negative is the mandatory, boring tutorial you have to play through to unlock the basic decks, though it's no more annoying than hearthstone's class unlocking.",1
16536,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI've downloaded this game through Steam and my mobile phone and am trying not to play it too much. This game reminds me a lot of Magic: The Gathering. I don't have anyone to play MtG with locally, so this is a surprising and welcome find. An excellent alternative to MtG considering my circumstances. The different colored factions behave much the same as the different colors of MtG, so the game was very easy to pick up. There's more play options available on this game than any MtG app I've found, so replayability/longevity isn't a going to be an issue.If you're in the same boat as me - you like playing MtG but don't have anyone to play with as often as you'd like - I highly recommend getting this game. There are many, many similarities to MtG so you shouldn't have an issue getting the hang of the game.

If you are used to Hearthstone's super simplistic resource method, this game is not for you. If you are an old dog like me who still enjoy card games with seperated resource cards included in the deck ( which by the way there are TONS of ways to use the amount of extra mana you have for your advantage) this is your game.",1

Eternal is a freaking awesome fusion of Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone. I always needed a new card game after MTG kept releasing such f*_king garbage computer games and Hearthstone became 100% about RNG, 100% bull$h½t decks and 0% skill.I only wish we had some more boards (but they are coming), different combat animations and some more dynamic music. Also I wish people like Kripparrian played this and I guess he would if more people played it but seeing as he makes his money doing Hearthstone videos, he plays that instead. Honestly, I'm just hoping this game stays the way that it is. It's not pay2win at all, they literally throw you free cards and free packs for just playing. The only things you absolutely have to pay for, are cosmetics that give zero benefit playing against the A.I. or other people and for a couple of very specific kinds of cards available through the long campaigns, but you can still easily buy these campaigns after a few days of gold grinding the gauntlet and playing against the A.I.Conclusion:I've spent days reading up on the meta, crafting decks and playing all the campaigns. I've played unbeatable Tavrod decks and I've gotten my butt kicked tons of times in a row. Yet unlike hearthstone when I do lose, I don't feel salty or ripped off like I do EVERY SINGLE TIME I play Hearthstone. Hearthstone either makes me hate my opponent or hate myself. I've won and lost 100s of games in Eternal and maybe only 2 or 3 times I felt cheated. As for the community, there's a little 'BM' here and there but NOTHING like what you sadly have to experience in Hearthstone.11/10. Love it or hate it, but seeing as we have no decent MTG games for PC or Console and Hearthstone has sucked for ages, I will happily take this for as long as it isn't anything like Hearthstone. 8/8 m8 keep the goodies coming.",1
16539,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewWhile I do like this game, I can't really recommend it.I've played a lot of Magic: The Gathering years ago, and I hoped this game could scratch the itch M:TG left behind. And while it certainly does scratch it real good. There is one glaring issue: Mana decides way too many battles.Yes this happens in M:TG too, but not nearly as often as in Eternal. You see, Mana draw can go into 3 ways: You draw not enough Mana to play your cards, you draw as much as you needed or you draw too much that you have no other cards to play. And sadly in most of my Eternal matches I draw too much Mana.In Eternal your deck of 75 cards needs at least 1/3 consist of Mana cards, however I often find myself still drawing 4 or 5 Mana cards in a row while having the bare minimum required Mana in my deck. The game does provide cards to make this happen less, like monuments (Mana cards that change into different non-Mana cards when you have at least x amount of Mana) or waymarks (Mana cards that do something extra when you have a certain amount of Mana reached) and cards with the Scout ability (allowing you to see the top card of your deck and decide to keep it there or put it at the bottom).However these things are not enough. In M:TG you don’t have a minimum Mana requirement, plus you have cards that allow you to search your deck (usually for a card) and lets you (often) get to choose whether you want to shuffle your deck or not. Making the chance you draw more unnecessary Mana in your next few turns a lot smaller. Also in M:TG you have cards that allow you to draw the first Mana card in your deck, making the chance smaller that you will draw a Mana card in your next turn. I know Eternal has cards that allow you to draw Mana from your deck (like Seek Power), but none say anything about it being the top one. So I assume it just picks a random Mana card instead the one that lies the highest in your deck (which personally also feels like that).I probably still play this game, at least until Magic Arena releases. And if you really need to scratch that M:TG itch you can try this game without issue. But If you can wait, then I’d say wait till Magic Arena.",0
16540,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewAs an MTG fan who didn't feel like spending 400€ + to even be competetive / creative in Hearthstone and who didn't enjoy most other digital card games (sadly Magic: Duels had an insane amount of bugs and crashes for me) I gotta say that this is definitely the game I'd recommend the most. It's the perfect mix between Hearthstone and MTG. Keeping the simplicity of HS alive while also allowing for Mana management and a lot more indepth tactics and card / deck combinations.It also doesn't feel like I have to spent an insane amount of money to be competetive.

16542,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe UI, terminology, and mechanics are way clunkier than Hearthstone's (although they're still nice). Never played Magic so I can't attest to that. The reward system is WAY better than Hearthstone's. I mean, holy, the rewards are done in a really generous and fun way. I actually enjoy playing against AI now. All of that being said, this game is plagued by the same issue as Hearthstone. Aggro decks are a thing, and control / unique decks are never to be found, which makes playing a huge gripe sometimes. Everyone builds decks revolved around cheap removal and tokens to trigger them (sacrifice tiny x to remove huge x) as well as super efficient low cost minions, then they just permanently go face.The variety is there. It's a matter of whether or not it's viable, and so far it seems like most of the variety isn't viable. That all being said, once again, the game is still good and a fun past time. Hopefully they work out the kinks in the future.",1

I am a complete Hearthstone convert now, this game is like the perfect balance of Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone, the finished product is extremely polished, and I can't get over how playable it is without dropping a cent. Kudos DWD and the Eternal community!",1
16544,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access ReviewSimilar to MTG but with some mechanics only available to a digital game.Feels pretty balanced in a rock paper scissors way where the meta shifts about every month.The game does a great job of throwing free stuff at You so that creating a top tier deck should be doable in about a week of play after starting out (with some disenchanting).It kind of stressed me out that many of my losses were due to either not drawing any power cards or drawing tons of power cards without any unit/spells (while playing a deck with big enphasis on draw/scout to minimize this) but I guess this is what You get with TCGs.,1
16545,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,Early Access ReviewAbsolutely loving the game.  Especially like the true free to play aspects where grinding earns you a great amout of cards and gold.  Every format from AI to PvP is a blast and every game feel meaningful as you build your collection.  highly recommend!  IF you are sick of Hearthstones RNG then make the switch to Eternal today!  IT really is the best of mtg and HS combined.,1
16546,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewOnly completed the breif solo campaign and introducing draft mode, but coming from long time MTG and Hearstone player: the mechanics of Eternal actually looks like what I always wanted Heartstone to look like. It remains simple in usage, looks of the game are sharp and clear, there is some stuff that isn't clear enough and could be specified better to have the strong mechanical feeling MTG wording has, but it is hard to nitpick at this point, as being an early access game it already works greatly. I really like the fact that creators clearly go so much deeper ONLY in parts that make sense for the game regarding MTG vs Hearstone gameplay differences. Is it better than paper MTG? No, and probably won't ever be, not only becouse of the fact that making up for 20 years and thoustands of cards of history isn't an easy task, but also becoue digital card game shouldn't be able to beat card game at being a card game, which means that the feeling remains stronger on the paper MTG version. But it takes the friendly warcrafty appearence of Heartstone and is skinning very well what MTG:Online is proposing (I am fully aware why the stack works the way it works on MTG:O, but it is very smart that this game avoids the need of it working like this, but still there are instants), making it so far my go to digital card game. I just hope that with the mechanical depth created in the game there will be a reason to play the game for competitve souls like me as for arcade reasons Heartstone might win it with its player pool. Fingers crossed, best of luck, cheering hard for this project!",1

16548,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game proved to me why Magic is being left behind by Hearthstone, Shadowverse, and Elder Scrolls.

This isn't entirely negative as Eternal focuses on online gameplay while most people know that the MTG online client is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for most parts.Let me go into detail about the things Eternal has in common with Hearthstone and Magic (I'll only use these two as examples, since they are the most known).Hearthstone similarities:- Presentation (UI, Voiceover, Design, Boardinteraction, etc...)- Business model (prices for packs/arena/story/etc...)Magic the Gathering similarities:- Core game mechanics--> Blocking attackers--> Using counterspells--> Building up mana using cards (without tapping)--> Keyword mechanics (such as flying, trample/overwhelm, etc...)--> Mixed decks (using cards from more than one faction/hero/color)Even though the looks and the online play model are very similar to Hearthstone (which I believe is a great feature (Hearthstone UI is beautiful)), the core mechanics of the entire game are vastly different, a lot more like magic the gathering: building up mana requires ""manacards"" (sigils/lands), attackphases have room for interaction (i.e. blocking/counterspelling), damage distribution of minions is altered (not easy to explain in short), ""arena"" (draft) has a slightly different model than hearthstone and you get to keep all drafted cards, other minor differences.I see quite a potential in Eternal as a card game, especially as it delivers a very good online mode for a mtg style game, while adding unique features to not make it look and feel like a carbon copy. It's also quite easy to pick up, but unlike Hearthstone, where netdecking (copying playermade decks) alone can get you to high ranks without much effort, eternal requires some good mechanic and card understanding to rise from amateur to novice and even more to master.Presentation: 8.5/10Gameplay: 8/10Accessibility: 7/10Overall Rating: 7.8/10 (for now).I recommend Eternal to any/all card game fans.",1
16562,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewIts a good and fair game. Probably has the best returns for investments of any of the digital TCGs floating around on the market. You get a lot of stuff for just investing a minimum amount of time. Also the most interesting features (Gauntlet, Forge and Draft) are fairly accessible - a few games and gauntlet runs here and there will keep you with a constant flow of in-game currency, which allows you to participate in all of them .So why am I giving this a thumbs down ? - There is one MAJOR game-breaking element in here: RNG - its a mess in this game - literally the ONLY reason (ok 90% ...) why I lose games is either getting mana-screwed or getting flooded - even with an absolutely decent manabase and fixing/fetching - its frustrating - its pure randomness - and allthough we cant avoid this in in real life TCGs it should be avoided in digital games as it doesnt add ANYTHING but frustration.If you are running a decent manabase the RNG shouldnt be the deciding factor in games like this. Its frustrating to lose to it and its also no fun to win because your enemy got screwed or flooded. It should be skill and deckbuilding that is deciding digital TCGs not randomness. And I`ve lost too many times to utter randomness in this game to give it a thumbs up.Still its a decent and fair game most of the time and has probably the best rewards system of all the digital TCGs out there.",0

16565,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access ReviewI have been playing for 2 or 3 months now and this game while not perfect is a lot of fun and TRULEY free to play. I have not spent a dime yet but as another mentioned they almost felt bad about how generous the free to play is so I may end up throwing a few bucks out to support the game. I have completed all the campaigns currently available and have stock pile of gold to use on the new shadow campaign once it comes out. I may play for 2 hours or so at a time a couple times a week. I ago afk for extended periods of time so my playtime isn't as much as it appears. As far as pvp goes I don't put a ton of time into building a deck or doing any research and have gotten to gold 1 last month. Not saying that's any kind of achievement but for a casual player with a lets just have some fun while I listen to podcasts I feel satisfied with it. I like the flexibility with the power system.,1
16566,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"As a longtime Magic player who then became a longtime Hearthstone player and then got kind of tired of playing both, Eternal lands in a nice spot in-between them that checks a lot of boxes. Eternal has a lot more in common with Magic than Hearthstone, and is probably what Magic *would* be if it were developed today as a purely digital game (getting rid of all that messy, complicated cardboard). Some things that I like about Eternal:There is some RNG in drawing too much power (e.g. mana) or too little, but there were ways to mitigate that before the new set, and the new set actually added a LOT more ways to deal with it in Pledge and Amplify. Generally speaking, the game lets you play your deck against your opponent's deck and there are lots of decisions to make; the ideal for any strategy card game. Games are, generally, over pretty quickly. Hearthstone, for being a ""simple"" game, has games that drag on, at least for me anymore. I like the quick play that Eternal affords.Eternal is very generous. You get tons of free packs, free cards, and all sorts of stuff just for playing. The ""dusting"" is more generous than other games and you can put together a decently competitive list on the cheap. Downsides? Yes, the tutorial can drag a bit, as can some of the single-player gameplay you have to commit to if you want to unlock all the cards in the campaigns. But it really is good reptition to learn the game, and if you break through, there are lots of different ways to play that let you mix it up when you get bored. Overall I'm happy to have found Eternal and it will be my go-to card game for the immediate, medium, and possibly distant future, given what other games are out on the market now.",1

Even though you have 0 wins, you can play against a deck with 6 wins because the two players have equal overall winrate.  4. You cannot even craft the best cards, you have to buy the expansion.

But worth a try thou.Edit: 7 hours into a game, tried multiple decks combination, some are my own, some are pre-set by the devs, and this game is double penetrated in terms of balance. Of course some cards in other games are op and broken but this whole game is based on that. There are decks with a 0% chance to win against, it's just that, you have to get ready to press concede with diginity rather than watching your health drops -30 or something.

16579,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI very much enjoy this game. However there is one complaint I have and that is the insertion of mana. The fact that I cannot determine how many sigils go into a deck baffles me. Part of deck building is knowing the split between colors, and not providing that option takes away a lot. It might just be me, but I normally flood every game I play, and this is due to not knowing how many sigils are in the deck. Other than this the game is fantastic and runs smoothly. It is as if hearthstone and magic had a baby and this came out. The cards are unique and playing the game feels rewarding. Excited to see where this goes in the future.",1
16580,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter 18 hours of playtime, I think it's time I write a fair review. I plan to be pretty thorough, but for the people who want a TL;DR then yes, I highly recommend this game. This is by far one of the funnest DTCG's on the market, and I couldn't love it more. It's like Magic the Gathering, but compared to their online game, it's more balanced, and the game plays much better. If you were ever a fan of Magic, you'll be a fan of this game. Going further into review, I'm going to break this into 3 parts. I'm going to start with pros, move into cons, and wrap it up with a summary of different mechanics and what I think is good/bad about different mechanics.Starting with pros:-One of the things that I love about this game is the way they have everything set up for making in-game currency. As of this time, I haven't spent a dime, but have a few legendaries under my belt. You can rack up gold fairly easily, as long as you're playing the game. Quests are pretty easy to do, but usually require a couple hours a day of playing, which is no problem at all. Also, if you feel grindy, you can grind out Gauntlet mode and just farm the computer for money.-The next thing I love is how drafting is approached in this game. When you enter a draft game, it works just like paper card drafting. You ""open a pack"", select a card, pass it, and select another card, until the pack is all gone. You keep doing this, opening a few packs and taking (I think) 50 cards. Then, you build a deck. The great part about this is, just like paper, you get to KEEP those cards that you draft. Then you play against other drafted decks. It's fun, and anyone who has ever played draft in real life will immediately know how this works.-Obtaining cards you want is generally not that hard. I built two themed decks, and while they're not perfect, they're definitely not bad considering how long I've been playing. This game has a disenchant and craft system, much like other DTCG's around.-The flavor and feel of the game is great. Each color has it's own overarching theme, and they're very interesting.Onto the cons:-There seems to be a general meta in ranked. I'm only Bronze 2, but from what I've seen there's a lot of Warcry and Empower decks (and they happen to be the decks I ended up going for too). Ocassionally I see some others, like a Primal/Fire control deck, or a Shadow/Primal infiltrate deck, but overall I see Warcry and Empower the most, probably because these decks have a ton of support. Personally, I'd love to see more support for reanimator, as reanimator is fun, and they have some cool cards, but there's not enough to make an entire deck based on it.-Legendaries seem extremely rare. The only ones I've gotten were the ones handed to me from the campaign, and the ones I've crafted. I've opened a fair amount of packs (sometimes 5 or 6 at a time) and not gotten one legendary drop from them. This isn't too bad, but I would love to open one sometime.-You can get mana screwed. While this is something expected of a game based on MTG, it still sucks. I've had times where my opening hand had 0 sigils, my redraw had 1, and I went 4 turns drawing into none. It feels bad losing a game because you got screwed, and it sucks winning a game because the opponent got screwed. Just feels cheap to me. And before you talk about me not building decks right, I just use the autofill for sigils. I could probably do better myself if I really put time into it, but I'm not that invested into deckbuilding until I fill out my collection a bit better.Onto mechanics, and what I like/dislike about them:-I love what they did with ""first strike"". I've always found first strike in MTG to be one of the most annoying things to deal with in certain situations. It provides people with a perfect blocker, as long as a card that always trades up when attacking (or deals significant damage to the face because you don't wanna trade up into it.) In this game, you have quickdraw instead. Quickdraw works like first strike, but only if the creature is attacking. It doesn't apply when defending. So, while the creature can trade up offensively, it's not a perfect blocker too.-Empower is a fun mechanic, and it's a powerful one. There's plenty of support around it, letting you dig for sigils in your deck, and some cards that play sigils for you. It's a super fun mechanic, and I like it a lot.-Warcry is the first mechanic I fell in love with. It's something you can't get out of a paper TCG, and it's very fun to play with. It rewards you for playing offensively by buffing your creatures in your deck, but you have to play smart and not hand your guys to your opponent just for warcries. It's a very fun deck to play, and there's a lot of strategy involved with it.-I love the way Relic Weapons work in this game as opposed to the similar mechanic of weapons in Hearthstone. In Hearthstone, your weapon has 2 stats. The attack, and durability. One of the problems in the recent expansions that I had was a ton of warrior weapon support with pirates that let them just play weapons early, along with pirates, and just continually smash your face repeatedly. Either that, or they can sit on their weapon and control the board with their face, which is annoying because you have very limited options in how to answer a weapon in Hearthstone (with there currently being I think 4 cards that destroy weapons?). Relic Weapons in Eternal are a whole different ballgame. The weapons give you attack, and armor. If you hit a creature, then that creature damages you back. If the damage equals or exceeds the armor value, the weapon breaks. This goes for being attacked too. You can't just sit on your weapon, especially if you're behind, because the opponent could hit you and break your weapon. You also can't just swing the opponents face with the weapon, unless they have no creatures. So this prevents aggro from spamming relic weapons and swinging at your face unfairly. It's a very well designed mechanic.-Last, my least favorite mechanic, deadly. Deadly has always been annoying to me, because it has such huge presence on the board. It can always trade up, depending, and if you get quickdraw on it, it becomes an incredible offensive tool. It wouldn't be too bad, except a lot of decks end up beating me out because of spammed 1 mana 1/1s with deadly. And there's not enough cards that have flat removal to make up for these annoying pests.Overall, I do love the game, and can't wait to see where they go from here.",1
16581,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is actually quite a bit of fun. I had previously played both Faeria and Hearthstone so the game play in ECG took a couple games to get used to but it has been well worth it! I highly recommend playing this game if you enjoy games of this type!,1
16582,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewOne of the bes things about this game is the free stuff you get. Your first win of the day gives you a booster pack. The short campaign gives you 5 starter decks, and you get some more free decks every week. The game is very generous in giving boosters. For example, instead of buying boosters for 1000 gold, you can pay 2500 gold to play the game mode called the Forge where you draft 25 cards and can win up to 4 additional boosters.It plays similar to like Magic the Gathering while only visually looks like Hearthstone. You can get all the cards without paying any money, but it will be a huge grind anyway. Eternal is more mechanic-friendly compared to Hex, but both are fun and different games. If anything, I'd say Eternal is more casual. Eternal still has a lot of advanced mechanics that you  can find in MTG though. The main advantage Eternal has over Hex that attracted me to this game was that this game is available on mobile platforms.",1

16585,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game is simply horribly unbalanced in my experiences. There are no real comeback moments because of the random chance to draw sigils which seem to limit your options more and more as the match goes on. The fact that someone can draw 30+ cards in a single turn and end up with a board totaling over 100 damage just speaks volumes about the thought behind some of the cards and their effects.I don't recommend the game for anyone who wants to play casually, only those who would play it ""hardcore"".",0

Also worth noting is the innovative draft system where you can come back to the middle of a draft a week later and continue picking from packs.As for the IAP products themselves, I bought a $60 bundle for 2 boxes of cards. I was happy with the amount of rares and crafting material I received to build new cards and decks. I bought the Jekk's Bounty expansion for $10 (?) and was happy with the campaign and the cards.

In just a day I've probably opened 20-30 packs, all F2P. There is a free to play ""Guantlet"" where you can earn lots of gold to buy packs, forge, and draft runs. You can put together a really great (F2P) gauntlet deck inside a week for grinding. They also have game modes like the ""forge"" where you draft decks, but play against the AI (in case you aren't ready for the arena, as in HS).

16598,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewEasilly the best digital CCG I've played. Not only does it have a deep and complex card system, it also has a slick and responsive interface. It's like taking Hearthstone and making it almost as complex as MTG. So you have the easy to use interface of hearthstone, but all the fun card interactions of a more complex CCG.Also they are extremely generous with cards. Hearthstone has a rate of 1 card-per-30-minutes spent (roughly, I'm estimating between gold gain and dailies). Eternal has a rate of 1 card-per-5-minutes spent (once you get past the early game card bonanza). And the packs are much larger, so even the cash shop prices are 1/2 to 1/4th as expensive per card. On top of that, buying ""any"" amount from the cash shop guarantees you 3 packs of cards for every expansion they release in the future (including +3 packs immediately).",1

16602,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is a fantastic F2P CCG. Multiple playmodes including draft, AI draft (forge), vs AI (gauntlet), and constructed, all with very generous F2P rewards. The game itself is very like Magic the Gathering with a streamlined ruleset and response windows.Certainly the game isn't for everyone, some people don't like making resources part of deck construction. I personally think it adds another dynamic, and is very fun for me. Another complaint I hear is that 75 card decks lead to less consistant gameplay. This isn't true... what it leads to is less combo oriented gameplay and less one-card build around decks. What it leads to more of is VARIETY. I have 220 hours in this game, and I'm not even beginning to get sick of the metagame. The 75-deck size is fantastic at keeping every game interesting and the meta-game from becomming dull. If all you want is to run a linear combo deck centered around 1/2 cards, Hearthstone might be more your game. For those of us who want more out of our TCG, Eternal is the best I've played.",1
16603,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe best bits of MTG and Hearthstone with (almost) all the bad removed.    Infinitely cheaper than MTG, with a way more generous F2P model giving it an edge over hearthstone as well.   The 5-colour mana system allows a wider range of decks and more deck-tuning options than hearthstone's rigid class-based system.    The problems of mana flood/screw which plague MTG have been minimized by the way the game forces a certain number of power cards (lands) in your starting hand.  Health returning to full at the end of turns (like in MTG) in addition to the fact that the defending player chooses how blockers are assigned in combat, destroys the ""Curvestone"" problem of brainless ""1 drop, 2 drop, 3 drop"" decks being overwhelmingly effective. The basic game mechanics encourage and reward slower decks with more interesting decisions!  Being developed by a great team including Legendary MTG pro-player Luis Scott-Vargas  The bad  As it currently stands, the game doesn't explain some of the more intricate interactions very well, and kind of assumes a certain level of MTG knowledge. For example, if you try chump blocking a creature with overwhelm (AKA trample in MTG) and deadly (AKA Deathtouch), you might be surprised when your 4 health defender only blocks one of the damage and the rest hits you. You can certainly play this game never having touched MTG, but you might run into a few moments like these that might feel unfair.   The starting campaign was a bit of a slog to get through for new players, and didn't really do the job of a tutorial in that it didn't teach about the kind of interactions mentioned above. HOWEVER, the introduction campaign has just been reworked and seems to be much more engaging now.  If you have ever had even a passing interest in MTG or Hearthstone, you should try out Eternal. Most of the problems that have turned people I know away from other CCGs have been put to rest in this game. ",1
16604,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you're anything like me and enjoy tactical CCGs like Magic or Hearthstone, you will love this one. For some reason, I will occasionally branch off to other CCGs (ES:Legends, Duelyst, Hearthstone, etc), but I always find myself returning to this. Direwolf does a really great job of providing content and it shows how much they care for their game. Give it a shot, it's free after all.",1
16605,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewFinally someone did a true Magic: The Gathering / Hearthstone mix!I'm an old time MtG player (think 1998) and Hearthstone legend player, and I admit the game looks really fun. Here's what became apparent after a few games:Hearthstone influence:- battlegrounds look and feel the same;- lots of battlecry (""summon"") & deathrattle (""entomb"") effects;- hero weapons.MTG influence:- untargetted attacks, blocks made by defender;- You have lands (""sigils"");- creatures are healed at end of turn;- flying, trample (""overwhelm"");- instant effects (played in other player's turn);- MTG-style mulligan.P.S. I love the fact that you can use A for attack-all, wish Hearthstone had something like this! ",1
16606,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewMeh, interesting mechanics and story. If you grind you can get everything that affects the game. It does very much pit you against people who have spent money to ""encourage"" you to spend money. Having never spent money on the game I am regularly frustrated at how often I face either a ""god draw"" or simply draw power the entire game against someone with a pay to win emblem. That being said, it isn't the money grab that is the current MTG or the pay-to-win of Hearthstone. The best card game I've encountered for a while.",1
16607,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewDownload this game right the hell now.Seriously.It's free, and it favours fun over grinding. I have a metric f***ton of cards already, and I only got it yesterday. You know Hearthstone's Arena? In their version, forges, you get to keep all cards you use. They have a fun and free single-player mode, which I also think Hearthstone lacks. And their mechanics are so much better.Some games are free. Some games prioritize player experience. This one does both.Why are you even reading this? It's a free game. Download and play it.",1
16608,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access Reviewthe first TRULY Free to Play card game on the market! If you want a good magic style game to play, then this is it! Whether you want to pplay by yourself against the AI or play against others, theres always something for you to do to get more cards or play how you want. Its such that you WANT to give them money and support the devs because the product IS so good and the game is more generous than its peers. However, BECAUSE it is a magic clone (and NOT like Hearthstone even though the pictures make it out like it COULD BE), mana screw/flood is always a possibly. So losses could come from you having too much/too little mana coming and vice versa. Still an excellent game through and through and i say everyone who likes this style of game should come and play it!",1
16609,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewI like the game but the only issue i have is the shuffler is the worst piece of garbage i have ever seenI have drew 20 plus lands in a game like this one until now or its just you draw no lands or you run alot of 1 drops and get zero of them consistantly but seriously the shuffler is extremely flawed that is my only issue,1

16611,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIt is fun, has good mechanics. Doesn't present new things, doesn't abuse the online element like Hearthstone does (ex. Bomber, Nosdormu and all the other weird cards). It's pretty old school to be honest, too old school. Don't get me wrong I like MTG, but this game lacks a lot because of this power/energy system. Sometimes in draft I get 5 cards that I can draw lands with, but they don't appear and if they do appear I have the wrong type of land. Most of my games were decided from the first draw, which makes it so not fun for me. For a skill-accented game it is pretty luck based with this weak starts. Still it has cool stuff and I prefer playing against AI, cuz it ain't taking ages .... But I just don't reccommend it.",0
16612,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Time to make a new review.It will be a negative review while at first it was a positive review.Aggro is like Hearthstone at the moment and this wouldn't be bad if Aegis didnt exist.Aegis simply needs to go and with patch we get more aggressive units with Aegis.Remove Aegis or give us AAAAAAAAA LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT of cards that can by pass Aegis like the new Vara.This game became garbage like Hearthstone only because of Aegis.Also Stand Together needs to be nerfed from 3 mana to 4 mana.The card is insane at 3 mana.,0
16613,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Gameplay is broken,and its quite sad,  it didnt used to be... After few nerfs there is one type of pvp deck that is usable, all other are much weaker. New players will struggle to get any coins at all, as old gauntlet, that was reliable source of income, is nearly inpossible to clear right now. You will have to grind for ages to get some in game currency, or just buy it for rl cash to get any progress, while somem time ago you could get thousands coins quite fast.. Its sad to see another decent looking card game killed by greed, but im sure its quite a success for devs. Its probably playable if you want to spend lots and lots of $, or you alrdy got account with all or nearly all cards tho. i personally didnt played for few months, after changes, and now as i came back, they done nothing to adress those problems...

16614,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Short: Loosen up with those sigils. It's frustrating to loose just because the game only gives you these.The game is pretty refined and very addicting, although the competitive aspect depends too much on luck (even with custom decks and custom power distribution).",1
16615,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access ReviewOne of the best if not the best CCG. All campains can be bought with ingame currency. The game is quite generous with free packs.

16619,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Update: it's quite tough to grind this game. There are a lot of fun game modes, but most of them are hard to play profitably. Especially the single player quests.Well it is a lot like Magic: The Gathering... fortunately that game is great, and Eternal adds a few features that make the online experience much better than MtGO and MtG Arena:- single game matches with players starting at 25 life- more forgiving mulligan (redraw) rule- multiple PvE modes- free to play",1
16620,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal is made by 2 former pro Magic players, and it shows: game mechanics are great.I'm a huge card gamer and I've pretty much tried them all (Magic, Hex, Hearthstone and many more) but Eternal impressed me for its generous rewards towards the players: if you play Eternal you'll be overwhelmed by a huge amount of free boosters for any kind of ingame activity, be it ranked or pve matches......and without even spending a dollar/euro!Eternal is a great online card game, hands down.",1
16621,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewExcellent game. If you like MTG and CCG in general, then this is the game for you. There are a bunch of different types of game types, it is rewarding and very fun. Nice artwork on the cards as well.",1
16622,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"A proper magic-clone with a good card economy. The ability to play on pc, phone and tablet really makes it great.Free initial campaign nets you several cards to get started with and there are multiple modes of play against AI and other players.Only drawback is 1v1 only, but for a free game with several mechanics, multiple expansions, a fair in-game market, paid options, consistent connectivity and events... can't complain too much.",1
16623,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewArguably one of the best CCG's on steam. Combines the visual aesthetic is similar to Hearthstone but the game plays a lot more like Magic the Gathering. I have well over 200 hours on this game and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon!Eternal has a balanced meta and card mechanics that could not be implemented in a typical trading card game. This game truly is refined and constantly evolving. Highly recommend this game!,1
16624,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewWhat can i say about this? If you're a Magic the gathering fan it's pretty decent and the only real thing that i has in common with Hearthstone is the style.as with all card games Luck can and will skrew you over as well as bless you and make you feel epic. to complain about RNG in a card game is just silly. I have not had much troubel at all with making decent decks on this game with  gauntlet mode and forge making it easy to get a decent collection as well as  the ability to frag all the extras and create what you want. Granted some cards are way over priced but think of it this way, some people payed £100+ for a zapdos or £1000+ for a black lotus in magic terms. All in All decent card game with a  mana system similar to magic, but slower paced than Hearthstone.And it's free to play so you can get a feel for the game before you decide to commit so give it a try!",1
16625,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewUPDATED OPINION:I truly enjoy this game for what it is, a digital card game that does not play like so many others in its genre, that severly limit your deckbuilding, that grant you one guaranteed mana each turn, that rely heavily on random target selection for cards and so on.It is weird that Eternal, which is very close to the granddaddy of them all - MtG -, is one of the more refreshing experiences in the world of online card games.It is fun to try out all the different colour combinations, to take a look at all the neat mechanics, multicolored cards, the beautiful art... the game has kept me entertained for 20+ hours without me ever feeling the need to go online and look other peoples decklists and the like. Can you imagine that?Figuring out what may be good by myself and grinding the different modes the game offers has just been a really good time. Now, this of course means that I do not have a grasp on the meta/high level ranked play yet - as I am sort of durdling around and experimenting still - but I simply haven't felt the need yet. With other titles such as HS or Shadowverse I felt very different from the start. Maybe that was because they did not offer multiple ladders for modes such as Eternal's Gauntlet (which has been a fun ride to Diamond until now, have not tried to go for Master yet), Draft and the like.So, to sort of conclude my rambling... Eternal's a good game.I very much enjoy the direction the game went in, and I honestly feel very nostalgic when playing it, since MtG is one of my most beloved games ever but I did not really get around to playing that a lot over the past 2 years. Eternal is filling that void real well though.---Old review/first reaction:So far, so great. I've just started out with Eternal, and it's stands out among all the digital card games available (Hearthstone, Shadowverse, etc.), simply because of how MtG-like it really is - which is a good thing in my eyes, as I've played that damn game for 10+ years of my life. A good digital version of MtG never really existed, and this might fill that hole for me.In a lot of other digital CCGs I always felt very limited when it comes to deckbuilding, but it seems that you really can go ham in Eternal in terms of color combinations and whatnot.The singleplayer content vs. AI has been really fun so far, and the couple of PvP matches I played were nice as well.Will update this as I go along.",1
16626,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewEnjoy this game a lot, the defense and faction mechanics set it apart from other CCGs. However I never recieved packs that were promised as part of a promotion that was actually the reason I bought in-game currency so until this issue is solved I̶ ̶w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶l̶e̶a̶v̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶r̶e̶v̶i̶e̶w̶ ̶n̶e̶g̶a̶t̶i̶v̶e̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶a̶d̶v̶i̶s̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶a̶g̶a̶i̶n̶s̶t̶ ̶b̶u̶y̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶g̶a̶m̶e̶.̶Issue solved, very responsive support. Now onto an actual review of the game. First I'll start with the cons. I don't believe that Eternal is the best or the most unique CCG ever. For me that honour would have to go to Chronicle: Runescape Legends (R.I.P). I also disagree with what some others have said that this is the fairest CCG out there for F2P players. Due to the sheer amount of deck faction combinations and the lack of any sort of cap on Legendaries used in decks, there are a lot of high-cost Legendary cards and the best decks contain a lot of them. You only have to do a quick search for Eternal decks to see that many recommended decks contain upwards of 18 Legendaries. You do earn coins very fast but not particularly faster than other CCGs. You are however given many more packs and single cards as rewards, and as far as I can tell the Legendary drop rate is higher than most. However, I don't believe this entirely makes up for the card volume and cost to the point where you could call it the fairest on the market.On to the pros. While I said it is not the best or most unique ever, I certainly believe it is the best and most unique CCG out right now. The mechanisms force you to actually use your head. Logic and math come into it more than most, if not all other games of this nature and you will find yourself in chesslike scenarios fairly often and will lose because of poor strategy rather than bad luck, such is the case with too many other digital card games.There is so much to do in this game, so many replayable game modes, including a vast singleplayer experience, something many will be grateful for. And the singleplayer campaigns are purchaseable with the relatively easily earned non-premium currency! As well as this you can keep all the cards you handpick in the Forge and Draft modes and, while the price of playing these modes is a little steep, you don't have to even play too well to earn at least half of it back. Also, free cards.All-in-all, I would say this is worth your time if you've played similar games but are after something with a little more depth.",1
16627,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI love this game. I've played Magic since second grade and this is the first time I feel like there is a another CCG worth my time.Pros:- you don't need to constantly spend money, you play to earn your cards. I think this is the most fun part of the game, it would be much less fun if they just handed you all the cards. (although you'll probably want to spend some money to keep this game going!!!)- drafting is awesome, you draft 4 packs and keep every card you draft (as well as prizes depending on how you do)- standard meta feels very balanced, nothing feels broken, so many different deck types that are competitive- you can win 1 pack each day for winning a casual or ranked match, as well as new quests every day to earn in-game gold- I usually have more than enough gold to draft anytime I want toCons:- art style is a little cheesy? (had to think of something)- oh and the story line in the campaigns is super dumb",1
16628,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"I have played just about every online TCG ranging from the most popular to the obscure. I have many years experience as an MTG player and have a wide range of knowledge on card game mechanics. I have been playing Eternal since closed beta, before their was an online store and you had to grind if you wanted a tier one decklist. This is one of the best teams I've seen on an indy game, many of them being MTG Hall of Famers. The game is relatively free to play and has many different formats to support different skill levels of players. With proper collection management, you should be able to craft a tier one decklist within your first few months of playing (I say months because I assume you are ambitious enough to attempt to craft a control deck.) Also, the integration between twitch and eternal is phenomenal, if you link your account and watch streams you will get a lot of free stuff. Now lets talk about gameplay. If you are transitioning from either HS or MTG, you will find the phases a bit odd at first. HS players won't be accustomed to interacting on the opponents turn and MTG players will be upset they don't get priority after every single action like MTG allows. But given a bit of time, you will find that the gameplay is really smooth and fair. The power level of the cards is a bit higher than MTG imo so that can take a bit to get used to as well.Their is a lot to say about this game but the wine is starting to kick in so I'm gonna leave it at this is the best CCG online. You won't find one better. I've tried. Give it a chance and I promise you will not be disappointed.",1
16629,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter playing both Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone, I have to say Eternal Card Game (ECG) game is a great blend of the two.Although I loved MTG for its in-depth strategy, fun limited drafting style and the game mechanics, the reality is that the game is expensive and takes a lot of time to enjoy. Hearthstone landed on the other end of the spectrum: It was cheap, easy to play but lacked the depth that MTG had.Eternal Card Game has blended the two very well and is a fantastic edition to the space. The Free to Play mechanic is awesome; It is easy to amass a large number of cards that you can then use to build a competetive deck while enjoying the game without feeling like you are grinding. The AI is good albeit easy to beat if you undersatnd how it makes decisions.Also, competeive multiplayer drafting is really well done in ECG and requies the amount of thought/skill of a MTG draft.For players who are not used to in-depth, mechanic and strategy heavy CCG, this game does have a much steeper learning curve than a game like Hearthstone. However, the pay off is very rewarding.",1
16630,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewHonestly the most fun ive had playing an online CCG. Hearthstone never did hold my attention well and i was always wanting a better Magic the Gathering online game. Now ive got it. A game system with mechanics reminiscent of MTG but with a way better client that is streamlined for fast and fun games. I would highly recommend this game to new and seasoned CCG players alike.,1
16631,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Initially I had a long winded review mostly describing the game play but imho if you enjoy card games and enjoy playing against AI or players you should dl Eternal CCG and try it out. (Don't forget to register your account on the game's site to get a reward.) It is a solid competitive card game with flaws like every other card game has flaws but where Eternal shines is both in its rich lore and great gameplay in myriad modes.  Play for free. or Pay in to get some glamour and glory.,1
16632,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe campaign is good, card meccanics are fun, and you can get a lot of them the f2p way.However, as soon as you try to go up the ladder, you'll realize that only a few subset of the cards are actually competitive...Somewhat disappointing in that regard.Also, the ressource used to play cards is obtained through card draw like MTG, so prepare to have games where all your lands or all your creatures are at the bottom of your deck ; both are a straight loss to the rng god.All things considered i suggest a pass on this one,except if you have a few hours to waste against the AI.",0
16633,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access Reviewgreat great game, except there is network problem sometimes.much more balanced than hearthstone, strongly recommended if you like card game that require no luck but mind power8.0/10.0, while it can be rated 9.0/10.0 if it's without those network issues.",1
16634,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewSuper fun. More interesting strategy than Hearthstone, but a better digital game than MTG. Tutorial will seem slow if you have experience with TCGs, though there are lots of interesting interactions between mechanics to explore.",1
16635,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal is a card game with a playstyle that's modeled after Magic: the Gathering, and a card collection style modeled after Hearthstone (but better!). It is completely free to play, with the helpful but unnecessary option of spending money on drafts or packs to help buoy your early game card collection.  You get to keep all the cards you draft, and you also get a decent amount of shiftstone (the card-crafting currency) for each pack you open.  The game is so free to play that I was compelled to basically donate to them so I could have an uninhibited play experience.This game is for all the people who enjoy playing Magic, but have issues with the Magic Online program for any of the possible reasons.  All I wanted to do with Magic was just jam games for free and against quality opponents.  Third party software did not quite scratch that itch, so when I saw Eternal was released I jumped on board and have really taken to it.  This is perhaps Eternal's greatest strength - the bingeability of the game - yet it can also be its greatest weakness.  Because people can just queue up indiscriminately, they play a LOT more games than normal, and the dreaded ""variance sucks"" argument comes to a head more often, because you literally are more likely to be screwed by variance when you're increasing your number of games played.  If you like to complain about variance, honestly, stop playing all card games, because variance is literally what makes card games fun. That or learn to accept your lord and savior Variance McGee into your life and keep a lingering smile on your face as the game engine hands you an unwinnable hand.The game design has done a phenomenal job with the first set, with an unbelievable number of playable archetypes in constructed mode.  It won't all be tier one, but with as wildly as the meta shifts in this game, it can be fun to find that one random deck you played 2 months ago which you just realized has a strong matchup against the current meta.  Some decks will seemingly never die, but Dire Wolf Digital has shown a willingness to step in and nerf cards it sees as problems, while also buffing a few underutilized cards a bit more rarely.  Gone for me are the days of learning the combat tricks in each color, which was a very fun process to learn much like a new Magic draft format, but a new player will certainly delight in learning how to play around the opponent's tricks.  Until a new Eternal set comes out, the intellectual enjoyment on my end predominantly comes from attacking the meta in a favorable manner.I've really enjoyed the product that Dire Wolf Digital has put out, and I think it has a lot of portability over from any other popular card game a new player might be more familiar with.  If you're new to card games, there will obviously be a bit more of a learning curve, but hey, this is completely free - might as well try it out!",1
16636,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEasily one of the best card games I have ever played. I dont review any games but, I can tell you this.. it is a great game. I gave up Hearthstone for this and have not looked back. This is more of Magic style game without being Magic. Highly highly recommend.",1
16637,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"I really enjoy this game. Most of time I play on my mobile and that title is really F2P friendly.

16638,Eternal Card Game,,hours on record for this game and so far it's holding up well enough. I've played most of the free online trading card games and this is the only one i've felt like i can stick to and enjoy for long periods. Cards are easy to obtain with daily rewards. Only down side is the player base. A game every 30 seconds to 1 minute isn't bad but i've fought like 10 different people over and over in the bronze/silver rankings. All in all it's my favorite so far and i approve of this game.,1
16639,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"This is in the top 2 TCGs for me. Recently, I switched to MTG Arena from Eternal, but it is still a good game. I have played all of the major TCGs (Hearthstone, TES Legends, MTG Arena).Other TCGs:  TES Legends -  offers competitive premade decks (that are affordable), which would be helpful for this game as well.   MTG Arena  - allows you to gain premium currency in-game without spending IRL money (through draft wins). Only TCG that allows you to do this that I know of. (Eternal offers twitch drops which do something similar, but no one wants to watch Twitch streams for drops, they want to play the game.)  Hearthstone - lul.Good stuff:  Free promo cards.   Most single-player content of any TCG.   You keep the cards you draft (this is also the case in MTG Arena).  Packs contain a lot of cards.Bad stuff:  If you don't log in during the time period for a promo, you have to craft them to get them. Not available in packs.  Too many cards for new players to learn: 4 sets in ""standard"" + promos + cards from 4 campaigns. I haven't heard any plans to rotate sets. Draft only offers 2 base packs and 2 packs of the newest set - which is good. Another set is coming December 2018.  Campaigns are too expensive to reasonably afford without paying IRL money. Getting campaigns with gold is also a waste, as you can draft 4-5 times for the same price.  Single-player ""Forge"" mode is a lot worse than the multiplayer draft version. Single player rewards are a bit lacking in general.  No real reason or incentive to buy packs, just rare draft or join a league. (Draft is 5k gold for 4 packs and you can rare draft. League is 12.5K gold for 14 packs. Packs are 1k gold each.)Overall, would reccomend for single-player gameplay. You are going to get destroyed online as a new player (same as every other tcg). PS: Pls add Linux version.",1
16640,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewIf you like randomly losing to an awful mulligan system than badaboom this is the game for you! Not to mention how inconsistent everything in this game feels. You go from a 10 game win streak to a 10 game losing streak instantly and you just feel like there's nothing you can do. Extremely frustrating and does not feel like a good enough game overall to put up with everything this game needs to make it playable. Go play any of the actual good mainstream games like MTG or HearthStone if you're trying to get into a card game.,0
16641,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI've played this game enough now to not recommend it to anyone.  Top-deck mode happens too often.  The game has a poor future because it is actually too free to play.  The designers fail to post patch notes most of the time.  Cards are buffed or nerfed with no explanation, or the explanation makes no sense.  Communication from the designers is sarcastc, brief to the point of little information, and uses in-jokes far too much.",0
16642,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"I gave it a shot and played it most of the day. I've been needing a new tcg since starcrusade ccg is being abandoned. After just a few hours I found the two main problems with it. 1. Pay for cards always mean pay to win no matter what game it is. 2. The ""random"" mana flood or drought. I know mana flood and draught has always been a thing but even when i followed guides on how to minimize this or avoid it. I could only get decent amount of mana and get my deck to work 2/10 times. That says to me it's a balancing issue or their deck shuffling is garbage. Enjoy the game if you like it but for me it's just not my cup of tea. Shame to since I was saving all my gold to complete a quest to join a draft. I'd probably return if they fix these two issues and stop making drafts so damn expensive. 5000 gold just to join one? Damn it's only 3000 for an event. Oh and one last issue the campaign is super short with only one additional battle after that. If you want to play more of it you have to pony up some real world cash. An option to unlock the campaigns with cash or the in game currency would be nice. Like i said if you like it good on you but it seems their really hitting peoples wallets hard. Game is great graphic wise and I enjoy the story though.",0
16643,Eternal Card Game,,ok the RNG needs some work because you can tell when it cheats you if you've been on a massive winstreak. Also a bit more balancing. Meta is nothing but kill cards (removal) and units that kill.,1

You either don't draw any resources and have to sit there with dead cards in your hand, or you draw nothing but resources and have to sit there while your opponent gets to do things and you can only play sigils.Oh, and if you aren't willing to dump your life savings into the game to get as many of the rarest cards possible, you can basically get bent.

The deck build are intereting and it has a wonderful level of depth, but the RNG is AWEFUL.  I've played several games and in most of them, I either draw 90% mana, or I get one or two and nothing more from then on.  It's back and forth.  I almost never land anywhere in the middle.  I think it's grouping the mana together in the decks, then randomly selecting cards from the deck, which results in a lot of numbers falling into the same area of the deck.  This means a lot of numbers fall into the ""mana section"" or a lot don't.  I have a multi-colored deck, as well, and I usually draw almost exclusively one color.

Too many games are decided by to much or to little power. This would have been ok a few years ago, but many other games have solved this problem. A CCG is random already, why make it even more random by not fixing a frustrating power/mana mechanic. It was a valiant attempt but if you goal is to make a better version of something than you should probably fix it's biggest problem.",0

Since in the best case scenario you play at least 2 cards per turn (1nrg+something) you go down 2 cards per turn and draw only 1.

While it has some interesting new mechanics, it's in essence just straight-up intellectual property theft.  It was enjoyable for a while, until I realized that it has learned none of the balance lessons that were learned by MtG over the years: they use rarity as a balancing factor, something MtG figured out was fun-kiling very early on, and they have lots of cards and mechanics that reward luck over good play.  What finally drove me away from the game was the atrocious mulligan system.  You get a single mulligan, and the new hand is guaranteed to have 2-4 lands.  There's no guarantee that they'll be the proper color lands in a multicolor deck, and the game has clear problems with its RNG as it'll land starve/flood players far more regularly than is statistically likely.  These factos combine to render a large number of games unplayable by one side or the other.  When these games happen in the play-at-will constructed multiplayer it's annoying but not a huge deal.

16653,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI currently have 37h in this game and it's kinda stressing me out sometimes but it's fun. Having played a ton of other card games before I feel like this games balancing is really not on point. There are just a ton of situations where you or your opponent can do absolutely nothing. The legendaries in this game are crazily strong compared to other card games. But what I really don't like is the mana system. It is kinda like Magic: The Gathering (the IRL card game, I don't know how if the video game(s) are the same), you have to play so called power cards to gain mana to be able to play actual cards. This means that alot of times get a hand full of these power cards and nothing to play or the other way around and just lose. Atleast one third of the deck has to be power cards so for example sometimes you draw like 10 power cards in a row with the minimum decksize of 75.In short if you think Hearthstone is a RNG heavy game the luck of the draw that you need in this game is insane in comparison.But if you want to get into this game it's not that hard to craft your first deck because you can farm the PvE modes pretty easily if you have a bit of experiene.The game has pretty interesting mechanics though that need some time to get into which enable some completely overpowered combos that just instantly win you the game.Overall I have to say that I have fun playing this game but I recommend something else until they rework some stuff.Edit: I just got access to Magic: The Gathering Arena and have to say that both games play very similar with their mechanics. Didn't remember it that way. Also you can get a bunch of free packs with Twitch Prime for Eternal if you're interested.",0

16656,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI think Eternal should exist because people have different tastes in life. Having said that, I don't really support the old scheme of resource draw (a.k.a. lands, or sigils in this game). The concept of mana flood/screw is a problem that shouldn't exist (the way Eternal manages mulligan is clever, but not enough). Even if you vomit your resource theory, it doesn't matter how pro you are if luck just screws you.On the other side, I have to say that Eternal had the best free-to-play scheme. However, like any other CCG, whilst expansions start to hoard, new players will have an increasingly difficult time to build a collection. No matter how generous the game it was in the beginning if it doesn't scale with the increased card pool. (At some point, you start drafting the same cards over and over, so you end with little to none value even if they give it to you).So, as a final veredict, I stopped playing Eternal mainly because mana flood/screws, it became expensive (in time) to farm resources (the return value is pathetic), and balance can be tricky sometimes. However, I don't think it is bad at all. If you are MTG fanboy you should give it a try. Otherwise, run from here and try something else to avoid wasting your time.",0

You'll start facing enemy decks loaded with ""Stun."" Stun is the most disgustingly unfun and uninteractive sh-t I have ever seen; it takes the horrible freeze mechanic from Hearthstone, that literally everybody hates, and multiplies it by 2 (literally).When someone casts stun on your minion, from any of the various sources, you cannot block with it that turn... then you can't attack the following turn...and you can't block the following turn after that...

16662,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access Reviewoh hey look another ""competative"" card game. lets check it out.-Card pool not too big yet, easy to understand.-very similar to magic:the gathering. If you play on mobile, this is the best you can get. pretty cool that you can play on multiple platforms.-Gameplay is snappy and works well, havnt run into any bugs yet and i have played most of my time on mobile.              Now onto the bad stuff-The game literally FORCES you into what you put in your deck. If you are familiar with Magic:the gathering....you have land cards. This game is basically the same. The deck size is 75....you are REQUIRED(yes you literally have to put this much land into your deck in order to play it) REQUIRED to put 25 out of your 75 cards as land cards into your deck. Now, as a gameplay mechanic this is fine....HOWEVER! When you get mana screwed(when you only draw mana) or vice versa(when you only draw spells/creatures) it feels like the game's fault and not your own. In magic the gathering if you draw wrong it feels like it is your own fault; rebuild your deck with less mana/more mana. Even out that draw factor. This game takes the option out to make the deck the way you want to and forces you into the choice of getting screwed in mana. Players will say there is a way to build your deck to even out your mana curve. This is not untrue, however being forced to build your deck with certain cards in order to make your deck more consistant takes our player choice and basically forces me into taking basic cards into my deck that dont belong there just to make the deck behave somewhat consitantly. Regardless the deck size is so large that no matter what you build the deck will play 1 out of 3 different ways. Anyway......   - Basically here is how each game goes....         1.You draw your cards. Do you like what you see? if not then redraw and go to step 2.....           2. Alrighty so you have your 2nd set of cards...do you like what you see? No???? ♥♥♥♥ YOU go to step 3.             3. Play your land cards and stuff...keep going...Uh Oh...The other player isnt really playing anything....or did he just surrender!?!?!? Looks like they failed both steps 1 and 2...keep playing your cards untill they lose/surrender. YOU WIN GOOD JOB go to step 4                 4. New game, repeat steps 1 and/or 2. If you fail either one of these steps, surrender the game and repeat. If both you AND your opponent draw a decent starting hand....go to step 5....                    5. Actually havea decent balanced ♥♥♥♥ing game.Long story short this game is broken, any form of balance this game has is ♥♥♥♥ing ruined by RNG and broken mechanics that have nothing to do with the cards individually. The only way to balance this game is to change fundamantal mechanics and that is sad because this game has potential. I will still play this game on the phone....hard to justify wasting time with this game on the PC. Play this game if you are a fan of card games, the free to play system is very generous and whatnot, just odnt spend money on this game, esspecially with much better card games on the horizon.

Mechanic wise I prefer the game over it's competitors like Hearth Stone but a major issue that I have with this game is the way they designed the resource system. Why in the world would you want to have your resources in form of cards in your actual deck? That poorly crafted design increases the RNG that TCGs have to deal with even more than required.

It ticked all the boxes I was looking for.Unfortunately I fairly quickly ran into the deal killer: Power flood/drought. This simply destroys the fun in far too many games. And yes, I am aware there are ways of mitigating this, but to me those cards simply plaster over the cracks in the design. Flood/drought is a bug, not a feature. I want to spend time constructing decks to fight an opponent, not to fight the (as I see it) flaws of the game itself.

16669,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI saw Weapons of Mass Gaming play this and figured I'd try it. At first, grinding Gauntlet was fun and rewarding, but after a few successful runs, the game just stops. I'm now in Diamond (the penultimate rank) and it's nigh impossible to get three wins in a row. The way the difficulty is set up is ambiguous and highly nebulous, and it seems like you essentially just got all of your F2P rewards, a few hours in.The game wants—nay, NEEDS you to play PvP. This is because the modern developer thinks PvP is content. It is not; PvP is either fluff, or the sole purpose of the game. The most helpful suggestions on the internet seem to be: play Draft, play Draft, and play more Draft. The AI will very frequently curve perfectly and ALWAYS have a fully-functional deck, even in Forge (vs. AI mini-draft), meaning you're always at a distinct disadvantage.The algorithm for shuffling is dubious, at best. Many, many players have stated that they will be either flooded or screwed for obscene lengths of time, and I can attest to this, even with only twelve-or-so hours, at the time of this review; it's not too uncommon to draw 12 of your 25 Power in a row, and sometimes for 2+ games in a row. The fixed deck size and Power requirements force this outcome, and trying to combat it with draw effects seems to make it worse.Generally speaking, Eternal is F2P, does allow you to farm AI, but really, it's just so rigid and laughably inbalanced that it doesn't matter. For example, my first Legendary was a 4/4 Relic Weapon for 4 that made 4, random, 1-cost things when it's destroyed. That sounds awful, and RANDOM ≠ FUN—I will repeat: Random. Okay? Does not, equal, ""fun.""You'll see some commons and be dumbfounded as to why they're not legendaries. Then you look at the conversion rates for crafting and see that it's mostly arbitrary, and you're just wasting your time. Once you hit those milestones, you're looking at hoping to get that one, free common after 3 wins, and it'll be worth one Shardstone. How much does it take to craft a common? Fifty (50). Why.The difficulty spikes suddenly, and never abates. You initially are afforded two losses before the run is over, but at a seemingly-random point it becomes one-and-done. Since the wooden chests only cough up ~25 gold in their death throes, and starting a Forge for your chance at a rare or two is 2,500 gold, you'll be hammering your left click to get through a lot of menus for quite some time. But, hey, if you want to just jump into ranked with a starter deck and ignore the literal concept of fun, you might get a little bit ahead of where I am, right now.Oh, and dailies are just more begging you to play PvP; they'll just stop letting you ""cheat"" by playing AI, you filthy non-competitive video gamer.",0

Card Design: 10/10 - I think the cards they have made for this game do a pretty job and making a good variety of different decks and different deck types. They don't mind balancing when think it is neccisary, and generally I've thought that they did a good job on buffs/nerfs.

Like getting 10 sigils in the top 15 cards, or getting 2 sigils in the top 20 cards. Things that should happen occasionally, but should not be happening with anywhere near the regularity that they do. It's probably the number one thing that kills my enjoyment of the game.The game's free to play model is pretty generous, but you will be absolutely destroyed by certain legendary cards that are so rare the only effective means of obtaining them is buying the large boxes that guarantee their drop rates.Is it worth it? I don't know. It's definitely got deeper strategy than hearthstone, but keeps hearthstone's problem of 1 card making or breaking a game if you lack immediate removal. It's also much harder to narrow down a strategy like you can in Magic thanks to the high power and high card limit requirements.",0

16683,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal Card Game is like Magic the Gathering (MTG) with a Hearthstone mix. The gameplay and mechanics are the same but the cards are named differently. As much as I like the graphics, I don't support the idea of copying MTG wholesale and pay to win. Try to come up with something unique and original if you want my vote. I'm basically seeing this as MTG with a reskin. As for copying of Hearthstone, there are a few abilities that are copied. If you know how to play Magic the Gathering, you know how to play Eternal.Conclusion, Dire Wolf Digital really copied too much of Magic the Gathering to be able to stand on its own. At least ensure that most of the gameplay is different. It does not bode well when a game designer like Scott Martins, copies wholesale from other games.PROS1. Some Abilities Based on MTG Spells but with a TwistKiller - One Time Attack Creature DirectlyInfiltrate - Do Something When Creature AttacksWarcry - If you attack the enemy player, the top card on your deck get +1/+1Destiny2. ArtworkNice to look at and well-named.CONS1. Pay To WinSigh. The Eternal problem. Buy Gems at 7000 Gems for $60 USD. Buy 2 Boxes (64 Packs) with 6 Guaranteed Legendaries for 5800 Gems.2. CraftingWant that card you need to fill up your deck? Make Shiftstone, the crafting essence. 3200 for a Legendary card and 9600 for an animated Legendary card.3.

Similarities Magic the Gathing : No Targeting of CreaturesYou have to use a special ability, weapon or spell to get creatures to attack one another6.

No Tradeability or Secondary MarketThe cards cannot be traded so there isn't perceived ""value"" in the cards and you make it way harder to form optimal decks since there is no trading. To get a specific card is pure gambling on the packs and crafting.10. Similarity Magic the Gathering : Strangers DeckIf my guess is correct, Strangers mimic the Sliver decks from Magic the Gathering. Strangers basically only affect other Stranger cards and their effects stack on one another.",0
16684,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewMana screw / flood happens way too often. This game wastes your time, even in the contxt of games being time wasters.

16685,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access Review3 card sets and 2 expansions already released, and Eternal is still plagued by the same inconsistencies as it was months ago. And it's a shame because the game could be really good if it wasn't for an unacceptable amount of non-games. More and more cards have been released with the intent to help with that issue, meanwhile we're still dealing with oversized decks, both in constructed and draft, without a proper mulligan to at least try and counter the variance brought by having that many cards in a deck. I really want to like Eternal and I can't wait for the day this review will finally change to positive, but right now I just can't. Edit: Client update recently rolled out, some UI and stability improvements, Set 4 coming up, everything looks nice... ... aaand the game still plays like a slot machine.

16686,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewPros:- The game runs smoothly.- The cards are generally easy to read when playing.- I never felt pressured to spend real money on the game.- There are some fun card mechanics that could only work on a digital game.- Competent, if unexciting, flavor and story.Cons:- The game is not very complex. Most games I played were both sides just building up creatures until someone topdecked a good card. I didn't really encounter any win conditions or playstyles other than ""turtle until you can play a big creature"" or ""swing with one or two smaller flying creatures over and over again.""- The individual colors don't have much of a set identity. As a result, most games feel pretty samey regardless of the colors used.- There isn't a very big card pool, so there's a lot of mirror-matching (games between two very similar decks) and repetative gameplay.- The ""Nighttime"" mechanic isn't well explained or developed.- Finding things can be difficult, as the menu system isn't immediately obvious.- While the basics of the game are explained well, certain mechanics and gamemodes are pretty much left for the players to figure out by themselves.- When drafting, the cards are very small. The cards with a full paragraph of text are difficult to read.- The western theme comes across much less than the intro would imply, and is generally extremely underdeveloped.- Each creature has a quote that plays everytime the card is cast. They get repetative and annoying almost immediately.- Energy screw and energy flood are a big issue. Games where one or both players can't play anything are never fun. Only being able to mulligan once is a glaring mistake.",0
16687,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI've waited long enough to review this and with the release of the newest card set I feel I can finally do so with accuracy.To put it simply, this game has promise, but right now it is just too imbalanced to be truly enjoyable. A ranked game gets you matches against almost the exact same one or two decks over and over (I'm looking at you, Rakano armory) because everyone knows they have the strongest combinations of cards and if you're not playing those like everyone else you mostly just lose with the occasional lucky win due to power and removal draw.If you're just looking for something to play casually and pass the time for 5-10 minutes, by all means, go for it. But don't get too into it until the game has had some more development and polish. It at least plays like a true free to play game with lots of rewards, so there's that.",0
16688,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,Have you ever tried Magic: the Gathering and found that you for some reason wanted a digital version of that? Have you tried MTG:O and found it's UI cumbersome and turned to Hearthstone for relief but found it lacking in complexity? Eternal might be the game for you - it plays alot like MTG but with a very sleek interface and great utilization of the fact that the game is digital to allow for some interesting mechanics that just wouldn't be possible in a physical card game.The game has a great community and is being actively developed (it is currently in open beta) - come play :)Update for release: This game is as good as ever with probably the best free-to-play model of any digital card game I have tried.,1

16691,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI also play on an iPad (iOS) and Android without Steam, so you can multiply my hours by 3.This game is VERY generous with free-to-play (it gives 5 decent decks to new players and about 10 packs per week) and it will scratch your itch for CCGs quite nicely. If you prefer your matches to play long (MtG) then this isn't for you.I played like 3000 hours of Hearthstone (on 3 platforms) and the ONLY disadvantages to Eternal over Hearthstone are:--Premium card art/animation is not as cool. (The upside is, you should just always destroy your premiums for the craft ingredients).--Game uses traditional random draw mana. They provide PLENTY of dual-lands but even so, you can get mana screwed or mana flooded quite easily. This is the absolute worst way to lose.For new players, there is (as of Jul 2018) a new expansion and we are kind of getting into ""This is hard for new players"" territory. We're not there yet, but the next expansion will put us there.At some point, they will have to develop a ""Standard"" format to support new players.My current plan is to play the heck out of this game until Artifact comes out, then jump ship.[This game is still 100% playable for new players as of Nov 2018. You will just have to get advice on which decks to build and which cards to destroy/craft. But like I said, about 10 packs per wee outright given to you...PLUS what you can buy with gold.

16695,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewCan't recommend. While the game is slick with some great design choices, they haven't meaningfully solved the problem of mana-screw and mana-flood, problems that have plagued Magic for 20 years.

Half the time the game goes perfectly, the other half it goes well until it floods you with this games version of mana while giving your opponent perfectly timed clutch draws.

16699,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis is a great game. you would definitely enjoy it and i prefer this card game than the rest. but there are issues that cant make me thumb up this game.1- Game Support. ive sent over 15 feedbacks and complains and i've never got once a reply. and i am still facing the same issues.I just wish if they at least respond once.2- internet and connectivity. i've lost many matches because of connectivity issues my internet speed is 15 Mbps and ive never got disconnected from any online game. i only face this issue with eternal cards3- Cards and rewards. I really believe there is something going on with these chests. its like theyve programmed these chests to drop the same cards with high priority; and rarely something new. whether the chest is silver or gold. Always the same cards even if you purchased a pack you will end up with the same cards. the only way to get new cards by crafting them and destroying your existing duplicate cards. And also from forge and dafts but that needs Gold  and Gems.4- I think the ranked matches are not balanced also. but you can still manage to makto revenge yourself back to the higher ranks even if you dropped back to a lower rank. it all depends on whether you get your influence/Power faster than your opponent. if your deck is full of power or if you have no mana then you are also doomed. its more luck than strategy. You can't even create the perfect deck coz always there is something missing and you need to wait until until you can craft it. i just wonder sometimes how some players same rank as you get 4 legendary cards in his hand while you have none.I don't know if its just me experiencing these bugs but if this game gets fixed ill thumb up this game.P.S. I do have a suggestion hopefully you can read it here since you never check your email.we can come up with an idea to solve this issue  if a player doesnt get mana in 2 rounds he gets a random influence and he could use this ability twice. if the player gets too many power/influence with no Unit/spell/Attachment cards in two rounds he can use an ability to allow you to discards two cards and get a random non power card from his deck and he can use this ability once. i think at least the game gets better and if they can reduce the amount of mana that would be great also.,0
16700,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewIf at any time, you feel like it was a mistake returning to a game after a few years, it's probably not worth your time in the first place. I'm playing after a long time and the whole idea of trying to build up a collection seems pointless given the fact that it would either take a 1000 hours or $500. Yes. you will get tons of cards as you play, but many legendary cards are so F**KING BEYOND BROKEN that your commons, uncommons and rare cards dont stand much of a chance. Legendaries are not easy to get with roughly 1 in 10 packs drop chance or 3200 dust cost, and the fact that you can use 4 of them in a deck means a well equipped player will wipe your♥♥♥♥♥99% of the time.Play for PvE (which is a massive timesink with very boring fights and poor enemy AI) and PvP-draft (quite fun, and honestly the best part of the game)Avoid otherwise. You're better off playing games which respect your time and money. Eternal does neither. Casual and Ranked play are♥♥♥♥♥♥  This wouldnt be an issue if it wasnt for the fact that a lot of daily quests require you to play against people, most of whom have vastly superior decks. Hope and pray your opponent gets mana screwed to win. Otherwise if you dont need to win, just play to complete quest and concede. Such fun.And yeah the game has mana screw, which is a massive f***king turn off if you dont have the right cards to help. Terrible mechanic that should have died with the pharaohs.If none of these issues are a big deal for you, then you will definitely find a very deep and entertaining game here! GLHF.TLDR: Draft is awesome, rest of the game is garbage. Play Artifact",0
16701,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game lives up to its reputation of being a mix of Hearthstone + Magic The Gathering. The only problem is that the gameplay is not fun! I truly gave it a shot, suspending disbelief and completing all the tutorials, playing an arena, playing some online games, but overall its just a bit too technical to be fun.Hearthstone was successful because despite it being so simple, its fun. This has superior mechanics.. but its just not fun to play.If you are looking for an alternative card game besides Hearthstone, I recommend Faeria.

16702,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal is a pretty straightforward Magic style card game. The game plays well, looks pretty, and does a decent job of letting you earn cards through playing. However, I have one major gripe: deck sizes are too large. There is a mandatory 75 card minimum, and at least 1/3 of the deck has to be mana cards. This leads to a lot of games being decided based on mana draws; because of the limits, both mana floods and mana screws are unavoidable. It's a fun game when you can play, but it's really dull (and frequently frustrating) when games are only one player doing anything because the other player is having mana issues.",0

16704,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Product received for freeEarly Access Reviewin short: MTG clone // excessive pay-to-winI understand that most card games will have some similarity with Magic The Gathering. However Dire Wolf really went one step further with Eternal and simply cloned Magic...right down to the lands which were a problem in Magic already and we now see smarter mechanisms in pretty much every card game. But I guess that makes it easier if you do not have to bother with rules and balancing and such. The card pool seems awfully large and I feel like I would need to put in way too much money to build a reasonable deck: 50 cards per deck allowing 4 copies each seems excessive and costly.,0
16705,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you're looking for a way to play Magic: the Gathering online besides the barely functional official client, this is your game.If not, I wouldn't recommend this game.This is the straightest ripoff of MtG I've ever seen.  Most puzzlingly, Eternal preserves what is usually acknowledged as one of Magic's biggest flaws: the resource system.  While every other Magic-esque game has sought to improve the system that Richard Garfield came up with in 1993 when no one had ever done this before, Eternal changes nothing.  Meaning you can look forward to games where you lose because you didn't draw enough resources, and also games where you lose because you drew too many resources and not enough business cards.  This was a source of RNG that even *Hearthstone* thought was too swingy and unfun.  If you like the idea of having a certain portion of your games decided because one player drew his cards in the wrong order and thus didn't get to play much at all, then go for it.But I kind of expect better foundation-level design from card games made in 2016.",0
16706,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewTL:DR - Feels like 80% Magic: the Gathering, 20% Hearthstone. It's a lot of fun. It has the deck building of Magic, with the easy UI of Hearthstone. A great mix.I tried this game after it was recommended to me by a friend. I instantly got hooked. If you enjoy this genre, it's absolutely worth checking out.It's very easy to learn all the concepts and abilities in the game, but there is enough variety and depth to the cards, that you can make any number of decks, using whatever strategy you want to try.It's also not pay-to-win. The game is very generous with free card packs, and the legendary(highest rarity) cards seem far more common than in other games. I've only been playing for a few days, and I have already opened over 10 legendary cards, and have built a top tier deck.There is a ranked mode where you take your constructed deck and battle other people, as expected.The part that I like a lot, which is unique, is that you can play vs AI and actually earn good rewards. As I was getting the hang of the game, I played in Gauntlet mode. It's a free mode(certain other modes require gold, which you earn by playing) where you face off against series of AI decks. You play until you lose, up to a maximum of 7 games, and the more you win, the better your rewards.If you want to up the ante from there, you can take the gold that you earn by playing in the Gauntlet, and enter the Forge league. In this league, you draft a deck. The game will present you with three card choices, you pick one, then you get a new set of three, rinse and repeat until you have a full deck. You battle vs increasingly difficult AI, like in the Gauntlet, but you get 2 losses and the rewards are much better than in the Gauntlet.The best part about the Forge, as opposed to say, an arena run in Hearthstone, is that you get to keep the cards that you draft. I think that's great.Go try it. ",1
16707,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI've played many CCGs, including Magic (I'm currently in the beta for Arena), Hearthstone, Spellweaver, and Shadowverse. I've been playing Eternal for about 2 months now and I can honestly say that of all the CCGs I've played, Eternal is my favourite. It takes elements from many of these other games and improves on them. It has the complexity of Magic (without the finicky stop points and minutiae) and the fast pace of Hearthstone (without the RNG and over-simplicity). Since I found Eternal, I've hardly logged into Magic Arena beta because Eternal is a lot more fun. The mechanics are original and creative, allowing for meaningful decisions that affect the outcome of the game. Progression is well-paced (even though I've spent some money on the game, I don't get everything handed to me and have to work towards a bigger collection by completing quests and earning daily rewards). Lots of different game modes, both PvP and PvE means there's something for everyone (and every mood). The meta is also very healthy. Don't listen to the negative reviews complaining about the state of the meta a week or two after a new set release - they simply haven't figured out how to counter some of the strategies being played, which is what CCGs are all about! The Eternal meta is way more diverse and healthy than the other CCGs I mentioned above - there are 6+ viable top tier decks at any given time, and some of these don't require any legendary cards (see the recent ETS tournament results for proof of this). The community is great too - lots of helpful friendly people on the sub-Reddit. I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy the fun and strategy of CCGs.",1

I continue to think the game is fun and worthwhile. I just started playing ranked games and that is alot of fun also. It does take quite awhile to obtain  cards but you can do with reasonable effort.

The synergies of the cards and the well thought out concepts of the developers is impressive. However I have 1 negative aspect of the game that is signifigant. The 75  card count and 1/3 power cards throw a GREAT deal of randomness into the game which leads to 70% frustration (why I have never liked card games) and 30% of the time a reasonable expression of the stratergy of your deck. ( I am unlucky and 30 turns into 20%). heck 15% of the time I get 3 power and many nonpower cards or  1 creature or spell with 7 power cards. It is NOT fun not to be able to see your stratergy concept play out even a reasonable % of the time.

16716,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI had to change my review from negative to positive. The computer does cheat, but only after you go on a hot streak and win quite a few free packs. Then the A.I. just does what it wants and you will lose. But, I'm ok with that. As long as it doesn't ALWAYS cheat, I'm fine with the house needing to come out ahead sometimes, even if it's unfair.This game is a hell of a lot of fun, for both singleplayer and multi. If even a little bit of you loves TCG's, look no further, this has it all. And for the record, I did support this game by purchasing all the campaigns and 2 full boxes of cards. It's a great free game, but it absolutely is worthy of supporting it to keep it going.This was my original post. I have changed how I feel and updated above.Game was fun until they recently ""upgraded"" the A.I. to cheat like crazy during any singleplayer modes. The developers must have got tired of people doing well in Forge and Gauntlet, so now I regularly lose way before completeing either due to ridiculous ""draws"" by the computer.Scrounging for 2500 gold only to lose 2x on the first match of Forge has happened way too much since they changed things.Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.",1
16717,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIt's like Hearthstone, but with a lot more rewards and strategic complexity. The game has its flaws, such as very bad pacing for the spoilers for the next set, and really corny and inconsistent lore. However, the core card-game gameplay is a lot of fun, and the game is extremely well-balanced in ranked mode and also has a very fun draft mode, both of which shower you in rewards (roughly a pack per day if you reroll quests, and each pack has like 10 cards). Unlike Hearthstone, the devs are very liberal with a nerf bat, and really unlike Hearthstone, they actually buff garbage tier cards all the time! This game is definitely my favorite CCG I've played, and I've played a lot.",1

16719,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter moving away from MtG and wanting to play a more complex virtual CCG than Hearthstone, this game scratched my card game itch perfectly. The game is extremely generous for Free-to-Player players and is very easy to pick up if you have experience with Magic. Eternal has not too much clicking, but still leaves players plenty of time to interact with each other. The community overall is great and players are very willing to help or provide you with information.Downsides:The game can be difficult to pick up if you have no prior card game experienceNot explaining phases or response windows can make it hard for new players to understand exactly what is going on ",1
16720,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewWhelp, what started as a hopeful replacement for the terrible current meta in hearthstone, i have put enough hours into this game's ranked play to conclude it's even more poorly balanced than yugioh, and even very low ranks are infiltrated with decks and players far in excess of what their ""rank"" belies. I'm strongly familiar with MTG as i have decades of experience playing it and am no slouch with strategy, timing, counterplay, bluffing, etc. While i credit this game for having the kind of depth that hearthstone lacks, it is a shame that the game is otherwise wrecked by awful balancing and match making. There are some absurdly powerful decks and combinations, and wouldn't you know it, 5/6 players you meet are playing cookie cutter top meta builds. This is identical in nature to hearthstone where players with 52+% win rate decks intentionally concede their way to lower ranks for the purposes of easier grinding of in game currency and quest completions off potentially lesser skilled players YET should they be interested in players of comporable decks and skill they need not procede up the ranks, as everyone is right there with them at the bottom. This game continues to suffer from the usual issues you can expect from a MTG knock-off (mana-flood/drought) happening way more often than one would think possible, and utterly avoidable considering the digital formating, the games quickly devolve into whom can be first to inact their imbalanced strategy or who is last to fail to achieve the power resources they need. This game's design philosophy seems mired in a swamp of developer ideas of ""what would happen if we made late game strategies possible by turn 2?' Genius. Also, Pay2win in the extreme. Not recommended for casuals and non-whales.",0
16721,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewIt may say that I currently have less than 100 hours of playtime as of the posting of this review but rest assured that if it accumulates the hours I put in on mobile... well, let's get on with it.It seems to have some of the basic concepts of Magic: Attack phase occurs simultaneously for all attackers, summoning sickness(Only affect attackers and not tap abilities), you can assign blockers or let them hit you(Unlike some others where you can target whatever you like so long as it doesn't redirect your attack), fast spells(Instants) and 5 colours. That's where the similarities end.Pros:1. Multiple game modes, gauntlet to test your deck against AI opponents to grind gold or if you have unstable connection, forge, soft of draft-like mode against AI again, casual play, ranked play and even a unique drafting mode! Direwolf Digital is active in being creative with the game and there are multiple events held to keep one entertained. 2. Completely newbie-friendly, complete the campaign to learn the basics of the game and play to get deeper and learn multiple tactics. For card game veterans or people coming from MTG, you should feel right at home with this game.3. RNG. RNG is quite generous in this game, you have high chances of pulling a legendary from a pack or if you have cash to spare, buy a box to support the devs and get guaranteed legendaries! Of course, you'll get a guaranteed rare per pack which is quite good as you can dissolve duplicates for shiftstone to craft other cards.4. Randomness. Sure there are meta decks but the randomness is what makes it fun. Meme decks? Check. Home brew? Check. Whacky deck that people say will never make it in ranked but somehow boosts you up the ladder? Check. The sky and your creativity are the limit(That and shiftstone).5. Active fanbase and discord server. They're ready to help you whenever you want or need it. This also means tournaments you can take part in as you get familiarised with and good at Eternal.Cons:1. Randomness. This may be fun but not much when the rng is against you. Drawing a good hand or a good card when you need it is less likely than say, obtaining a legendary from cracking a single pack. Some draws are ridiculous and mulligans don't help much. You might get power-flooded or colour-screwed due to the game's drawing mechanism. However with the update of 2-4 sigils after mulligan, it helped, not much, but still helped a little.2. The timer reset. As with every game, there are bad sports, salty players or plain sore losers. The fact that the timer resets every time after they delay is a hassle. Problem is not really with the timer as people who run control decks may be forced to rush if so, but with these sort of players wasting time and ruining the experience. Not really a fault with the game or company, just the player base.Overall a pretty good and unique card game. May even be a solid contender for mtg with what it's doing right now if not for the loyal fanbase over for WOTC. Solid 4/5",1

16727,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewWell, in short, the game is pretty meh, it has some cool ideas, but messes it up by not having good fundamentals. They increased the variance (which was already the main drawback of games like Magic the Gathering) to such an extent that most games are simply decided by RNG/topdecking. Some cards are also kinda like that, that they can win the game in a turn, if the opponent doesn't have the exact right answer at that one turn. Being ""Mana"" flooded for a few turns is pretty common (it's almost impossible to avoid with a decksize of 75! statistically speaking)So, yeah, all these factors lead me to believe that the creaters fundamentally don't understand the basic mechanics (and more importantly mathematics) of card games OR they jsut wanted to make an ultra casual MtG clone (which is hard, since MtG is alredy pretty casual in some ways)",0

16733,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal Card Game Review - Raymond KTSummary: Six-guns and sorcery collide in Eternal, the new strategy card game of unlimited choices and unbelievable fun. Eternal brings AAA pace and polish to the the infinite possibilities of a deep strategy card game. The only limits are your own creativityWith spells and swords, six-guns and subterfuge, heroes collide in the struggle for the Eternal Throne. Where will you stand? Join the battle in Eternal, the new strategy card game of unlimited choices and unbelievable fun.Variance. A lot of people will say ""variance is in all card games, it's part of the game"", and I will agree with them. However, when playing Eternal in any of its formats, there are far too many ""non-games"" - games where you have drawn too many sigils (lands), or too few, or are missing a colour entirely; games where you have drawn poorly and/or the opponent has drawn perfectly; games that are not really games, because either you, or your opponent, did not really participate.Eternal is very much a 'value' game rather than a 'combo' game, 2-for-1'ing your opponent is always what you play to, and often what you lose to. While out-valuing your opponent can be fun, often a single 'out-value' moment can snowball into victory. Why? Deck size requirements are too high (45 for sealed, 75 for draft), you can only mulligan once, and games are a 'best of 1', which means that consistency is regularly quite low. With this, even the best decks can easily lose repeatedly to lower tier decks, even if the match-up is favourable.Also, this issue of variance practically doubles in draft. The limited format is decent, and the card design makes it clear that MtG professionals have assisted with creating the set. However, the drafting stage takes place with AI bots (draft with bots, play against live players), and the AI often make strange choices that lead into odd drafting signals. Packs also have extremely poor variance, often only containing one card of a particular colour. Due to this, it's quite often that you will be passed a pack where there are literally no good picks for your colour(s) (even at pick 2), and even pack-1-pick-1 can be extremely poor. These issues exacerbate the previously mentioned variance issues, often leading to a bad draft experience. ",0
16734,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewIt does some things right, like taking advantage of its digitial nature, with card gimmicks like Warp, which lets you play the card if it was the next card you would draw from the deck. It also does some things wrong, like no card play history left me frantically hitting the replay button to learn more about the card that was just played. Yes, there is an instant replay system, although it was often too fast for me to read the cards, (even in slow mode) and some cards don't go to the graveyard where you can read their effects.The tutorial holds your hand a bunch, often forcing you into bad moves to teach a point, until about the last two colors, which makes it easily skippable, since the game already shows hints throughout. It also blocks the screen a bunch with info telling you more about the card effects each time you draw a card with a new effect, which makes it even easier to miss what the opponent is playing.After the tutorial, I started with the Gauntlet mode (since it was my first quest), and it was always somewhere between, beating the AI to negative HP or getting mana drought (even with the very nice 4-mana mulligan system in place to lessen it, yes even in the pre-made beginner decks.)  I forgot to mention that the last round of gauntlet always has a gimmick, like ""the top card of your deck is played instantly,"" which often results in gimmicks that favor the AI and that the next time you play gauntlet, it's a harder difficulty, which does not benefit players who simply want a quick way to try out various decks with AI or earn quick gold.The worst part is that the AI will often continue playing cards to stregthen it's army, dragging the match on further, even when it has a flying creature you can't block that does lethal damage to you. While it usually makes smart moves, it often plays very slow, which can be annoying when you're losing. This is something I expect from either a player who doesn't realize they won, or one who likes to torment their enemies, not something a bot should do.As for draft and casual games, in my experience, the queue times are only about a minute or less, although if you jump right into casual you're going to be playing pre-built starter decks vs customized player decks unless you buy some packs with in-game currency. The reward system for both gauntelt and draft is good, you get a few loses before it makes you start over, but you always get rewards, usually gold at first, then gold and cards, then gold and card and free booster packs. You also get free random boosters each time you level up one of the individual colors. (I mean random as opposed to specifically giving you more cards of that color.)Puzzle mode (or as it's otherwise known ""Win this turn or die to a fire spell"") isn't very rewarding as it gives you very little gold, and very little practical application since it's a dumb solution to a hypothetical situation that would never happen in a game (like you having 4 power and 4 types of influence, but your opponent having 12 power 2 types of influence.)Gold is used to buy packs about 1000 a pack, and 5000 Gold (you earn at about 25 Gold per match if you're a bad player in Gauntlet, 500 if you play against players, who often have better cards than you) is required to buy enough for a draft, which you keep the cards from. Crystals are for more exclusive stuff (ususally cosmetic stuff when it's only purchasable with crystals). There's a thrid currency called Shiftstones, and you get them for beating various objectives, and can earn more by turning in duplicates of cards you don't use, but I still, for the life of me, can't figure out their purpose. I now figured out you have to right-click on cards in collection to craft new ones (you can also destroy cards you hate for more shiftstones).Even though I did some find enjoyment playing it, I was often bored and/or frustrated with very long games that rewarded me very little even if I did manage to come out on top.   I can't personally recommend this game, because if I had a dollar for each time I conceded a game in casual, I'd have enough money to buy a better game than this. (Although it's still better than MtG: Arena)",0

16736,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewNot worth playing in current form.  19/20 games decided by power card draws or lack there of. You end up feeling as if you never did anyting to win and never did anyting to deserve losing. Not a good combination.Too much competition. All other major card games do their niche better. Eternal should have made the decision for a new power system. Shadowverse beats it on originality, Magic beats it at the game magic invented, hearthstone quicker more approachable. Solution could be a complete restructureing of the power system. More likely to be implemented some sort of cycle system. Let me cycle power cards (for when I have to many) and let me transform cards(into power) or cycle them (for when I draw no power cards). Right now they are relying on the ancient ""land"" system without the mature card collection. ",0
16737,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI've played all the usuals, HS multi time lgend etc. Currently play TES:L and learning Prismata.I’ve only played around 60 hrs, so I acknowledge the problems I am expereinceing with the game are from a perspective of someone that desn't know it very well but...  Kick off with an obvious one. Not keen on the mana system, leading to frustrating games with flood and screw. Yes one mana per turn systems have their own problems. I often don't seem to have many options of cards to play. Resulting from lack of good card draw and having to draw mana from deck? Games often end up with players top decking against each other. First to draw something good wins. Blocking vs direct attacking system is heralded as more complex therefore better. I agree it is slightly more complex as you have to think about all the possible permutations of your opponent blocking but I don’t think its better. Whilst it does make for slightly more technical thinking, they mostly aren’t interesting decisions to make and are usually just either correct or incorrect plays. It also leads to a lot of tedious stalemate boards. Again wait for a good top deck. The argument that the greater mechanical complexity of the game (e.g Instants, blocking, mana management etc... ) when compared to for example HS is a good thing I think is wrong. Again it doesn’t seem to lead to any more interesting decision making just for a more technical game.  Some strategies seem stupidly easy to play. I crafted a Tavrod Midrange deck that  required very minimal decision making and very easy to win with after only a few days experience. ",0

16741,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewI have a lot hours in this game and I think I can say its safe to say to not waste your time playing this game. Also the review I'm giving is strictly for people who are interested in finding and playing a card game more competively than casually. Let's start with the things that are just wrong about this game and shouldn't be in here.    - 75 Card Decks:    The decks that you make have to be 75 cards instead of the standard 60 that are common in most other games. This makes deckbuilding and playing with your deck an absolute nightmare. There are lists that you can find online that have the top tier decks in the game (and trust me I built them), but with 75 cards in the deck the consistency of drawing cards and the way the deck is supposed to play is significantly reduced. The deck size should be 60 cards, and then you have a 15 card side board (though sideboards don't matter in this game either and I'll explain later).    - Mulligan:       Doing the standard mulligan in this game is dumb. In this game if you don't like your seven card hand starter you have a chance to shuffle your cards and redraw another seven. Unfortunately you can only mulligan once for some reason, so if after you mulligan and your hand still sucks well that too bad cause youre stuck with it. Let me give you an example of how it should be. If you ever played Magic the Gathering (another better card game) before, the way their system works is like this, you start with seven cards if you don't like your starting hand you can shuffle and redraw cards down to six, if you still don't like your hand you can go down to four cards, if you still don't like your hand you can go down to three (though this never happens) etc, etc... The point is you have more say as a player on what hand you can get where as eternal complete restricts you for some reason.    - Coin Flip:      Normally when you play a card game there is some sort of coin flip for who goes first in playing. Eternal has this also but for some reason if you are picked you HAVE to go first. Now in other games when you do a coin flip, the winner has the option if they want to go first or not, I know it sounds weird but there are some times when you would rather not be the person going first (It doesn't happen always but trust me sometimes you will want to). This is more just a pet peeve of mind but it just goes to show how much eternal doesn't trust their player base to make their own decisions.     - Best out of ONE:       This is without the doubt the most annoying thing in the game and is so utterly frustating it is basically what made me not want to play anymore. For some reason ranked matches are a best of ONE, basically if you getting terrible starting hands you are guaranteed to lose the match and thus lose points on your rank. Sometimes in games you are bound to get unluckly  with draws but thats why in most other cards games when you play competively, you play your opponent the best of THREE. For the life of me I have no idea why the game is like this, I can't begin to tell you how absoultely frustated you will feel when you are playing ranked, and your starting hand is bad and you wish you could mulligan but you can't cause eternal only allows two for some reason, and you wind up losing the game cause of it, but not only that you lose points on trying to rank up. It's absoultley ridculous and it just goes to show that eternal is no where serious about competive play.     - Unbalanced Cards:       Some of the cards and game mechanics are straight up broken, and by that I mean you essentially have no way to lose. Some cards in this game are so grossly good that if you play them the opponent essientially has no way to win, the game basically becomes a race of who can play the best card first, I've played tons of other card games before (Magic, Hearthstone, Yu-gi-oh, Pokemon) and I can safely say that eternal has just some of the most ridiculous cards I've ever seen.     - Drafing sucks:       Finally the last point that I want to make is about how bad the draft system is set up in this game. For drafting in eternal you aren't drafting with a group of seven other people live like most other drafts normally go, instead you have a limitless amount of time to choose cards and packs will be rotated around to random people (there is a little more about how this works online if you want to look up exactly how drafting works here), these drafts aren't with a group so it essentially takes all the fun out of a draft because normally when people draft its fun to play against the people you were passing the packs around with to see what cards they took and what decks they built. Also eternal has done another weird thing where the deck you build for draft is 45 cards, this isn't as much of a big deal since you draft 48 cards in total but I just find it odd. Also draft matches are not the best out of three, they are again the best out of ONE. It's so dumb because in draft you get random cards that you pick from, so your deck is bound to have inconsistencies in it, so if you get awful hands well too bad f@#$ you cause now you lose the match.Here is the good things about Eternal...     - It's free and it will only take you 50 hours of grinding to get a semi good deck if you don't want to spend money.Overall, if you are looking for a card game to play online to take more seriously just go play Hearthstone,  Magic Online, or Magic Arena.",0

16743,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewWow the review I spend an hour typing didn't post after I hit post review...Anyways short version because I don't want to type that much again: first mission/quest you get is to complete the campaign which is horribly RNG coming from an experienced player of card games and you will spend a long time just completing that. You have to win 17 matches (4 for each of the remaining factions and unique deck style boss) against the AI after playing the 4 matches forced on you. The boss alone took me 10 re-tries because it is pure RNG since he has a Sliver deck if you've played MtG and although a lot of the slivers don't have useful abilities once the useful ones come out you lose unless you can counter. The game has the same issues as MtG which means mana drought/ mana flood/ creature and/or spell flood which just means you lose unless your opponent is also experiencing difficulties. This also means that those initial 17 wins tooks me close to 50 matches becasuse I had horrible RNG and the starter decks are not very good.PvP matchmaking does not exist as of the moment! You will need to spend time/money to get decks able to consistently win in ranked PvP matches since casual ones don't exist... In addition the daily quest is to win in PvP so you are forced to play ranked unless you have 5 spare boosters so you can play draft which I didn't have. Proceeded to go 0/5 in my placement matches because there is no matchmaking and my starter deck was pitted against multi-legendary decks. I don't recommend this game unless you are a masochist, willing to invest the time to grind out a good/decent deck, or willing to spend money.The good thing about this game is that the factions or whatever they're called system is very versatile like MtG because you're not limited to 1 or 2 of them which means you can make some crazy multi-faction deck or at least theorycraft one.",0

They throw TONS of boosters your way, but rares and legendaries are very strong, hard to come by and good decks contain many of them. The latest set is almost 40% more expensive than the others because of a drastic spike in legendaries.2. lack of decisionsOnce you know the rules and the unintuitive special cases you are a robot playing your deck. It mostly (but not exclusively of course) comes down to luck. Contrary to what is said over and over, there are very few decision points in the game. Especially in the beginning you are usually VERY limited. Your deck, draw and matchup matter most.3. power systemThe power system is flawed and frustrating. It makes me anxious. It's also a reason why decisions are extremely limited.",0

16747,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewNot a strategy card game for sure since every legendary card is broken ,they all could easily just text ""win the game"".All game depends on a single card way way more than a decent combo and the means to bring that combo on table.Card sets include many more cards than they should and this ends up to the point where you loose a lot of time to shuffle throu ussless staff that shouldn't even be on the game.It's a pure money pit or better a money black hole since no matter how much money you have spent on it, if you don't get your legendary card but your opponent(who has spent zero money on game)drow and play his leg first he wins.Just play magic or hearthstone,at least there you get what you pay for,a chance for better tactics and strategy.So play for free until you realize that all leg cards are lerroy jengings and uninstall,until then pls pls don't spent any money on this.",0
16748,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI like what the game is, it has a lot of fun mechanics and features, though a bit unbalanced.However, I simply cannot recommend this game. I bought the Jekk's Bounty campaign for a little fun, but mostly to get the extra cards to hopefully expand the ranked game. I'm sorry to say, but this campaign is absolutely rediculously difficult. Some bosses are easy, but the ones that are difficult are so beyond difficult it simply makes the game unfun. I'm not opposed to a campaign to play through to gain new cards. But I shouldn't be stuck on one boss for multiple games, to which I still haven't been able to defeat, just to get the reward of cards.I don't mean to compare this game to Hearthstone, but at least when Hearthstone makes me pay extra money for cards gained through a campaign, they don't make the campaign so rediculously difficult that I basically can't complete it. Instead they make the main campaign for the cards fun, and the diffucult part for an extra bonus such as a card back. I just don't understand why the developers had to make such a rediculous campaign for some cards that just aren't that powerful. So completely agonizing.I'm mostly dissapointed that I'm stuck on this campaign that I paid for. If I could get a refund then I wouldn't care as much. But since it's a ""promo"" item, this means I'm stuck with a campaign that simply is not fun, and is more frusterating than anything now. The worst part about it is that I feel not that I've completely wasted my personal time on a campaign boss that I still can't defeat. Absolutely rediculous. Figure out how to balance this. Poor developing completely.",0
16749,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game seems fun, but the twich promotion is one of the worst executed advertisement i've seen. If you're going to attract new players who might have played other card games don't make them sit through a very long unskippable tutorial. I played through the tutorial and because of a verification issue had to relog and was made to start the tutorial all over. This completely killed any drive i had to try your game. There should really be a button to skip the tutorial, the fact that this isn't in a game in this day and age is baffling.",0
16750,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"This game has got to have one of the worst tutorial modes I have experienced so far.I have been doing the tutorial and campaigns for two hours now and I still don't know how many of the mechanics work.The tutorial itself feels thrown together and not planned out, the story they try to tell you sounds boring and I personally would have preferred the game to not tell you any of those pictured stories at all or at least provide proper narration since the voice acting can't even remotely compare to that of hearthstone.Instead of telling you straight up what the actual battle phases are and what you can or can not do they make you go through the trouble of only being able to use the highlighted cards (even though you can play other cards in the actual game mode).Sometimes you are allowed to play cards before attacking, sometimes you are not but they won't tell you why that is.The individual card skills are not explained properly and I personally struggle a lot because the voiceover itself is in english while I am forced to play the game with german subs/flavour texts as there is no option of using english only or german only, neither in the game settings nor in the steam settings. This makes any sort of immersion into the game extremely difficult.The language settings thing is more of a complaint towards steam though and not so much to Eternal, as I have the same problems when playing the Witcher and some other games. I do hope that they will release the english language pack for other countries though.Anyways, I have played hearthstone since beta and enjoyed it until a year ago when I quit because of the greedy blizzard ecosystem where you either pay up or play mindless aggro decks.I also used to play lots of yu-gi-oh and some MTG when I was little and some Gwent after I quit hearthstone, yet I am still having trouble with the Eternal rulesets because of their badly thought out tutorial system.I decided that I will give it another 2 hours or so of playtime and see if the experience changes somewhat or stays the same. I must say, so far I am rather disappointed. I get that the game itself is supposed to offer more depth than hearthstone while not being as deep as MTG. But shouldn't they at least have given you a smooth start into the game instead of forcing you to play only highlighted card for an hour while barely explaining the mechanics or at least which mechanic triggers first?So far I am everything else but impressed with the game, it has some good core mechanics but somehow feels way too rushed out, like they needed another month or two to polish it up properly.

16751,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewIf you come from Magic and you have no problem with its mana system, you will probably like this game. If you come from Hearthstone, you will be delighted to see no randomness in card mechanics. If you can deal with luck of the draw and some unwinnable games, enjoy! But if you want to be in full control of your game every match, this game is not for you.If you are running from Hearthstone or you want something that is closer to Magic without paying hundreds in Magic Arena, this game may be for you. No randomness in the mechanics of cards! It is a much deeper game than Hearthstone for example, though that is a low bar to clear. It showers you with free cards and entire decks! But power is still tied to rarity, so when you enter draft-mode, make sure to just get the rarest cards.But you will be able to make a very large variety of decks after playing the campaign and doing a few quests and dailies. The grind is definitely more rewarding than most F2P games as well. But in terms of design, it suffers from the exact same falws as Magic. If you do not draw the right cards at the right time it is over. Many people in casual AND Ranked will quit on you after the third round or so because they did not get what they needed at the beginning of the game. And honestly, I understand why. Much like Hearthstone, you can end up with an incredibly overpowered board that your entire deck may not have a single answer to. And those games are painful. I have stopped enjoying my victories as well because all I can think of is ""Poor guy, looks like he didn't draw anything useful, I've been there."" Half of your games will be that exact experience. Either you got the cards you needed or you didn't. Your hand may be full of creatures you do not have the energy to summon, or it is full of energy without creatures to play. This game is still in Early Access and it shows. The UI literally hides important information from you because it currently CANNOT display more than one symbol at the top of cards. Confused why that creature insta-killed yours? Look closer, the game just didn't tell you that this creature has that ability because it was overwritten in the UI by another ability. The game certainly has balance problems as well. As you play against more experienced players, you may encounter cards that you read 5 times before realising that the card is working as intended and your opponent just brought back his two most powerful creatures as well as his two most powerful buffs with a single card that hardly scratched his manapool.

16752,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI quite enjoy this game, since I wanted to scratch my MTG-itch. It does a lot of stuff right: the game speed is nice, GUI is enhancing the experience and there's a sense of progression as you grind your way up.What I don't like is unfortunately a core mechanic of the standard game: dead draws! How can they still be in a new card game?!It feels so punishing drawing resource cards when you want some kind of answer for the board. On top of that the deck size is 75 cards with a maximum of 4 copies per card AND you're forced to make 1/3 of the deck resource cards!This game wants you to use a more watered down deck than MTG, increase the RNG and restrict your deck building even more. I really feel this is a core problem with the game, so much so that I wouldn't recommend it.From what I've seen this is also the nail in the coffin for other players.In my mind the fix for this problem would be: allow Hero/Avatar powers. The 5 campaign Heroes each already have their own 2 Mana spell, which has a little effect (gain 2 armor, ...) and draws you a resource card. Why not make it a permanent ability?Also remove the 1/3 of deck forced resource, so people have more freedom to build.I think I'll spend a little more time with this game, but once I'm bored I won't revisit it again unless there's a core change that tackles the dead draw problem. I only wish this promising game would stop sticking with frustrating mechanics of the past or else it will die rather quickly.",0

16754,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI've played over 700 hours of this game. Most of this time was a necessity due to injury of not using the off-hand, and a mouse only game was appealing. Pros:1) Interesting cards and combinations of cards including applications of different factions. When you get to know the game there are many combinations. However when you get to know the game you'll also know the cons the developers have not addressed nor do I suspect will they.2) Graphics to go with card actions are well-done.Cons: 1) You will spend hours not playing, but watching the same combinations of deals occur, which, neither allow you or the opponent to play. The game play is hurt to the point I do not recommend anyone attempt this game.2) They say that with your redraw you will ""always get between 2 and 5 Sigles"", this would then be that there is a 20% chance of receiving 2 Sigles. In fact this is 80%+ you will receive 2 Sigles on the redraw. If you choose a 2 Sigle draw, 3 out of 4 times you will not see another Sigle for 2 to 4 turns. Meaning you watch yourself fall behind and lose, wasting time and having no fun. There is a lot of no fun in this ""game"".3) If a 5 Sigle draw or redraw, (draw can sometimes be 6), 3 out of 4 times you will see nothing but Sigles for the next 2+ turns. 4) If your draw is a combination of unit cards, spell cards and/or items, you will have a playable hand. If your hand is units, you will receive units, if your hand is items/spells and sigles, you will receive items/spells and sigles 3 of 4 times for the preceding 2 to 4 rounds.3) Regardless of knowledge and deck design you do, you will not be competetive with those, I can only assume, who have paid money and receive a different algorithm in the deck dealing and card drawing.I do not recommend this game to anyone.",0

16759,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewShort review: Everything seems really good, except of manasystem which is from last century and is the thing that I hate most about MtG. If this is fixed, then this game could seriously contend with HS. Also the monetization model is much greedier than HS. I would give it a neutral review, as I enjoy the game and will continue to be playing it despite the shortcomings, but since that is not an option: the greediness of the monetization means constructed is locked out until you grind nonstop for a few weeks, which makes me give it a negative one.Sidenote: So that I don't sound like a whiny kid, I will admit that I did spend more than 40$ on the game, which denotes how much I enjoy playing it as it's one of the better online ccgs out there. At the same time it does not deny the shortcomings, because of which I cannot recommend it to my friends. To be fair I don't think there is any online ccg I can recommend to my friends as this industry is really greedy... Well except for faeria, but that game is killing it's potential and creativeness is declining, so I am considering changing my review for that as well.Extended version:I really love how the things this game does and how it plays out. Mechanics, flavor and other things are great. It doesn't rely on RNG as much as hearthstone but still manages to keep simplicity of HS while providing plethora of interesting options. Basically if you enjoy any of the current CCGs like Hearthstone, MtG, Spellweaver, Star Crusade, Elder Scrolls Legends or any others you will have high likelihood of enjoying this.There are a few minor issues UI issues that will be fixed later (like button on the screen to declare all attackers or a bit more seamless casting of spells) BUT there is one issue with the current game that I find troubling: Mana system.Basically the reason I cannot recommend this game is because of the manasystem that is straight rom last century. Manascrew and Manaflood are same as magic so even with all the upsides, this game doesn't solve this issue, which is the worst issue in magic. Unless new game mechanics are introduced to alleviate manascrew, this game will not have lasting appeal. Overall this game seems good and interesting and I will follow the development of this game, but if this game will still have same manascrew/manaflood issues that I am fed up with in magic, then I cannot recommend this game. Another minor drawback is that there are no hero powers like in HS (Star Crusade and Spellweaver do this part really well), but I could live with that if not for the manasystem.Update: After playing the game longer (basically for whole week nonstop), I have to admit that manascrew is not as much of an issue in this game as in MtG as there are a few mechanics that help it. Though I still consider this to be quite a big issue. But the bigger issue I have found in this game is how greedy the monetization model is. It might seem like you are getting more stuff from boosters and drafting as you get to keep the cards you have drafted, but that is counterbalanced by the fact that to get enough gold for another draft you will have to win the draft. The crafting costs and the fact that you need 4x of any card (including legendaries) mean that it will take quite a lot of time/money until you are abe to build half decent deck. Although there are a few aggressive archetypes that you can build quickly and don't require legendaries, but if you want diversity and deck brewing, then you are out of luck.Update2 with new set: After half a year of unchanging metagame we finally get a new set... Half of which is are reprints of first set. I could technically be fine with it if this had some redeeming qualities, but the sad part is keywords aren't nearly as well designed as in the first set (they still have interesting interactions, but they are much worse). The cards are overall less exciting and the game isn't even trying to be creative anymore. Feels like they just stopped putting real effort into making the game itself better and are only focused on making it look better.

And they have an Arena that you face AI opponents, but the arena really tests your skills.This game only has the Gauntlet and that's mainly for new players to get some cards but their belief is that the money is in PVP so they discourage solo play in the gautlet by increasing the difficulty after each win to the point you can't win anymore.

16762,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game AI is stacked against the player in a way that cheapens the experience.  For example, if you are building a new deck to test out in Gauntlet mode, at first your build may seem to be working, but once you get to the 4th round, the AI will either short you sigils for the power you need to play your cards or not give you any sigils at all, even if you stack your deck with ample sigil aquisition cards.  This happens 9 out of every 10 times you attempt to play.  And then if you do manage to beat Gauntlet if you try using the same deck again without significant changes to your cards, it will go into kill mode and usually wipe you out in the first round.  Just try it.  Build a deck and play gauntlet for about 6 hours without changing your deck.  You will get to a point that you simply cannot win with a deck that was working perfectly before due to bad card draws and OP perfect AI card draws to bring you to EXACTLY 0 hit points no matter what you do.  And if you happen to get within a couple of hundred gold to having enough gold to play Forge or Draft (2500 or 5000), you can forget about winning any ranked games either.  You will hit a losing streak of 6-10 hands in a row due to bad sigil draws again!  Absolutely ridiculous.

And finally, the reason I hate this game and won't ever recomend it or say really anything kind about it is THERE IS NO PRICE BREAK FOR BUYING MORE! there is NO difference between the lower amounts of gems and the higher ones. Meticulously designed to give the illusion that purchasing more will give you more, whilst actually they're f***ing people. The gems you do get? ITS HOTDOGS TO BUNS B*** ***T.

Unfortunately all card games suffer from statistically overpowered cards but most get fixed eventually, Eternal' cards for over a year have had the same broken card's at the top with no editing to their power levels. The developers are direwolf and I now understand why direwolf has recently been replaced by a new development team for the elder scrolls legends. They're incapable of making a balanced game but maybe it's intentional for money grabbing.I would say ditch this game unless you have a small brain with a long attention span for boring games and love brooding over new players with your pay to play netdecked build. I say seek a different CCG.Eternal - 1/10  I got 1 point for having Yeti card's. other than that their is no selling point the artstyle is tradgic too colorful. Seems to be illustrated by an obnoxious kid with too many crayons.",0

16771,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access Review6 / 10  =  Concept, gameplay, design are wins, but end result is a 'FAIL' for me  In general ... it's a good game, easy to learn and play, the diversity is pretty extensive, good selection of elements as basis with added neutral cards allows a good selection for decks and then the possibility to 'multi-class' between elements brings in the real complexity of such games. Most of all is the simplicity with some beautifull deco and cards effect.Unfortunately, this said .. there's the cons side ... let's start with details .. description of effect and such .. You cant put much on cards so I do like the overlay for detailed info .... but there a lack of precision in those said details, all you can read is always the same generic message ... they need to look into others games to really understand this part.For last what reaally sinks them is the sigils concept. they control the level and power of the cards but also link to turns. unfortunately the fact that it's not garanty that you'll find since you need to draw them as you would other cards. soo you  have 50 cards in your deck then you add 25 sigils makes it 75 cards .... 1 third of those cards are sigils ... the outcome is the side I hate from this game ... you can either get min/max amount of sigils . If you get a min amount its game over since you cant afford higher cards, in opposite if you get too many on a constant basis.. your level does go up but you have nothing to play or defend with, this leaves you with the 'fair' amount throughout the game ... which is either win or loses ... but after how many failed turn due to unbalance sigils distribution ...",0

The gameplay provided by the rules framework is compelling, and would be enjoyable to those that like MTG type games.One increasing concern I have is just how much more powerful the legendary cards are over the rares. The amount of power above the curve gained on legendary cards is pretty silly.The game would play a little better if rare and legendary cards didn't get such a big efficiency boost over the more common cards. Many of them do not feel costed correctly. As it is, the ranked ladder usually becomes about 'who draws more rares/legendaries'.

16796,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThere are many Hearthstone clones that import mechanics from Magic the Gathering out there.

16798,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewAn online game that freely rewards you just for playing against IA ALWAYS deserves a positive review! I've played like 10-12 hours on Steam and maybe another 20-25 on my phone. Not much but I'm giving my point of view.I'm a person who always expects a lot from a game. If it doesn't fit my tastes, then I quickly drop it after an intensive period of trial, so first the negative points:CONS:- The collection is really extensive, and the possibility to have in your deck 4 copies of a same card, including legendaries, makes me think this is not purely F2P.- The crafting system is unbalanced aswel. You can't disenchant a Premium card for half the cost of making that same Non-premium card. Just for those of us who enjoy a ""complete collection without glowing things"". Please take that as an advice. PLEASE DEVELOPERS. ^_^- TURN ONE. Guys, you forgot to make up for the player who starts second. Resource differences here are maybe not essential, and the blocking system seems fair... but still, the 1st player can have 2 or even 3 units on board in the second turn while the second player has nothing.-----> This isn't a CON: The resource system can sometimes make you lose a game, yes, but hey, that's why there are ""draw emblem"" cards. To cycle and thin your deck.And that's why the game itself forces you to include a 33% of power cards in a deck. The ""old general rule"" in any classic card game.What happens in Hearthstone when you have an awful start while your opponent has a very good one?PROS:- Pretty much anything else. Animations and graphics, card design, controls, rules, atmosphere...- A cheap and challenging way to try your skills and decks out against IA, and getting cards. You can earn gold in Gauntlet then spend it in Forge. Free, without having to play against experienced or P2W players.- A HUGE BUNCH of mechanics. Making a crazy deck is really fun although 90% times it can be garbage :D- LOTS of game modes.

16801,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"I have to compare it with hearthstone because it's very similar and we all know that hearthstone is at the top right now. I will break into parts while reviewing.Pay-To-Win VS Not So Pay To Winish As Far As I Played..We are all aware that hearthstone is p2w, because without packs you can't have cards, without cards you can't make a decent deck without a deck you are enforced to lose. earning packs is not that easy or fun and when those hard-earned packs give you only 1 rare card it gets really annoying. Lets not forget that they bring a new expansion each 3-4 months or so you have limited time to get the cards you want. you can always pay though.. In this game as far as i have seen it is easier to earn and drop legendary and epic cards. I got like 5 legendaries in my 5 hour playtime. each pack gives you 12 cards. you have more chance and you get what you deserve. P.S hearthstones pack rates made me a fckn psycho.. 1 legendary in 30 packs.Gameplay1-This game has so many card types that i can't even remember while playing. I think a majority them make no sense. charge,poison,stun,spells i can understand every card game has them but there are many others that i can't even remember their name. Hearthstone is easier to understand for these aspects (IDK in what condition it is right now). 2-So you can't attack minions in this game directly with other minions. you select your minions to attack, if the other player chooses to block with one of his minions, you attack the minion instead of the hero. It's a little different and i didn't like it. It gets so confusing with other aspects of the cards. While playing i was like "" how the f did he attack me and i couldn't? "" or ""I just blocked you how can you attack my hero?"" I simply don't like it.3-your mana does not increase on its own. you deck consists of 75 cards, 30 of them are by default mana cards that when used you gain 1 mana and can be used 1 each round. this made the deck creation process more hardcore. You can decide on this yourself but sometimes i was drawing like no mana cards and stuck at 4 mana while my oponent was at 11 manas.Events-Singleplayer etcI only played the tutorial singleplayer mode and it felt normal like hearthstone would have. Also the same modes do exist like creating a deck and playing with other players until you loose a certain times for a prize.I think that is all. I was really hoping to like it but i did not. maybe i still have a love for hearthstone deep in(I don't play anymore). or maybe it's just bad and confusing like i said.",0
16802,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewSome issues I have with this game:* Imbalanced* High Variance (playing this is like playing roulette, you can win/lose even against more powerful/weaker decks just based on draw)* Poor ratio between mythics  and rares (basically most of the powerful cards that you are gonna need for a deck are mythic level)* Due to the 75 lands per deck and just the 1 mulligan and the presence of the mana system you can get so easily mana flooded or screwed.

It's a fundamental flaw with MTG and any game that copies it. It boils down to luck on who gets the useless mana flooding and who doesn't. You'd think this is something that would happen rarely, then it keeps happening.So while it's not a bad game by itself (I have played it for 400 hours after all), the problems stack up to me not being able to recommend it.Also in this game in particular: if you lag a bit before a match starts, the game will boot you out of the match for inactivity - meaning you lose the match immediately as it starts without getting the chance to do anything. Another reason why this game isn't about skill.",0
16819,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewThis CCG has the worst RNG and matchmaking ever. It is a fact. Constantly match bronse players with silver and gold ones who has much more cards for example. RNG constantly give you only sigils but other ones or vica versa. Don't waste your time!,0
16820,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Early Access ReviewHidden mechanics that make PVE a less and less enjoyable experience in order to push the player into the P2W PVP formats.Starts off as an enjoyable magic-lite copycat but turned into a highly negative experience with some questionable design decisions along with the mechanics designed to force players into purchases.,0
16821,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewA great card game with interesting mechanics, and rather generous card distribution for a free-to-play allowing players to earn a free pack of the latest set every day.Unfortunately uses the red shell spyware program, and the developers do not seem interested in removing it.

This is very subjective but I can't support a company that goes out of there way to ban me for the name ""BeaverJuggler"" - which is at best a mildly suggestive sexual-innuendo that only adults will get to begin with, even if that wasn't even MY intention but is purely a result of Direwolf staff projecting their own thoughts and delusions on other people.I paid for this game, I played it a lot.

16823,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewWhat you'll read on the vast majority of comments will be the same : less complex than magic, a great entry point for non-CCG players, while still allowing more interaction than Heartstone.I played this game in closed beta, and it was fine... apart from two detail : it felt sluggish, and AI's deck aren't balanced.Let's just say it didn't get better with realease on steam and servers a bit underdimensionned.Every time someone plays, discards or draw a card, there's a quite long (> 1 sec always, average of 2 secs) animation, and if the card itself triggers effects, you can reach the 20-30 secs without anyone able to play nor skip those pesky animations.There are even combos playing on this waiting time to prevent opponents to declare blocker becasue their time ran out during the animations.About AI decks... even in the beginner's campaign (yes, the thing you have to do before you can start modifying your decks...), you'll encounter legendary cards that are played in tournaments, without being able to remove, for example, the ""gain 5 life for 3"" crap cards of which there are 4 in your deck.To resume : The core of this game is good. But you may give up before you reach it.",0
16824,Eternal Card Game,2016.0,Early Access ReviewI really wanted to like this game being a huge fan of tcgs but the resource system is the worst i've ever encountered.  I promtly lost 9 out of my first 12 games due to not drawing enough resources which immediately turned me off from the game.  The absolute worst thing you can experience in a card game is not even being able to compete and dying without playing a single card.  This game needs to fix its horrendous mulligan/resource system before anyone should even think about investing time/money into it.,0
16825,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"This game would be really great except for one issue: The card cost-effect balance, especially for instant-kill cards, is very-much skewed towards the low end. This means that single use spells like Torch (1 cost, deal 3), Deathstrike (4 cost, Kill any unit), Vanquish (2 cost, kill any unit with 4 or higher attack), Treachery (2 Cost, deal 2 Damage and discard a unit of your choice), and the like... are extremely spammable, meaning that control decks are entirely too powerful, since the enemy could at any time just throw out a bunch of damage/instant-kill cards and it's game over for any deck that relies on units or stacking effects. It means that there are a whole host of game mechanics that just go out the window in the face of a control deck which hard-counters every single other strategy except Aegis-spam, and can win even then if they play tactically.And that's the problem: Control is so viable that there is only one strategy that forces it to play tactically for the win, excluding situational outliers.What would help this is if spell costs went up significantly for spells like htis. This would limit the use of such a spell in the early game and force players to  Or, perhaps, if they were balanced by effects: Deathstrike is a 4 cost spell that kills a unit, but that unit deals its attack or health in damage to you, and Vanquish kills a damaged unit with 4 or more attack.",0
16826,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewPoor MTG and Hearthstone rip-off with an emphasis on a draft environment that is as shallow as a kiddie-pool. Skip this one, and stay playing MTG. This is just a bad bad bad bad game.",0
16827,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is fun on it's surface...But the reality is it is heavily geared towards Pay2Win.Thats fine for some people, but not me.Don't waste your time if you don't plan on DUMPING CASH into this type of ""free"" game.",0
16828,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Everything about this game should be great, but they ruined it with a horrible resource requirement.  Much like MTG, there are cards like 'mana' resources which are dealt in your card draw.  It results in those games where you could be the best player in the world but lose to bad luck of drawing only resource cards every hand, or never drawing one at all and not being able to play your cards.  Why this is still a mechanic is baffling.  It's so flawed and other games have fixed it.   My suggestion is either deal two cards per turn and let players play one face down as a resource and lose it (adjust the deck characteristics, obviously.)  Or just do it turn based like some other similar games do.   Both of those options eliminate a great deck or player losing to bad luck.    MTG has had that problem and has been around for over 20 years, and it's always been a problem that people hate.  Why go back to that?   Other than that they are sitting on a truly great card game.    But it is like building the greatest boat in world and putting screen doors on the bottom of it.   It is painful to see something so close to greatness completely ruined by such a cringy face-palm of a decision like needing resource cards in your deck.  This game, besides that awful game-ruining mechanic is immediately obviously an easy 8/10 for deck battling card games.  But with that flawed mechanic, I, in my brief but perceptive opinion, am so disappointed at losing to bad luck without having a chance, it gets knocked down to a 2/10.    PLEASE change this stupid mechanic, it really does the beautiful complex game a slap in the face, to be mild.",0
16829,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"I do not like this game because it is a Magic: The Gathering clone (it is not a clone. It has added its own stuff like influence and other things)I do not like this game because several other reasons:-The tutorial. I get it. It explains nearly everything. But it is too long.-The matchmaking. I get placed against people with really good comps. As a new player who has no cards at all, except the tutorial cards and standard ones, this is frustrating because you cannot win at all. The game is kinda an a**hole too because it does the except opposite of what happens in every YuGiOh episode ever. ""The heart of the cards"". Let me explain... I need several cards. And i will never draw them. Never. Not a single time. This is so frustrating.I mainly dislike it because of the matchmaking.I tried many decks from the internet, tried different decks in my 3h gametime. I haven't won a single time. I am used to card games like Magic: The Gathering and i know that it is normal to not get the cards you need from packs...But still. Very frustrating.",0
16830,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"If you like Magic. It is exatly the same thing. I tried playing a couple games, but it is sooo dumbed down. I only played for just a few hours and the whole thing is just a long tutorial. The cards are obviously pre-determined and you literally get no choice of what you play. You can't move on until you play the card it wants, just like a tutorial. Complete waste of time for anyone who actually likes to play the game themselves.",0
16831,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access Review**DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY**The resource mechanic absolutely ruins an otherwise fantastic game.The art style is amazing, the lore is amazing, the impact each of the cards have and the balance between archetypes is amazing. None of that matters if you can't actually play the game. And thats exactly what happens in the majority of games. You either draw way too many resource cards but no units to spend them on, or no resources at all. The amount of games where a 1/1 minion has slowly whittled down me/the opponent is absurd. There are plenty of other games out there with cool art and lore that actually let you play them. ",0

16834,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewEternal is a very interesting card game that really feels like the best of both worlds (magic and hearthstone).  the animations are good and the system is interesting.  However, the card game is ridiculously oppresive for new players.  All the default ways to get cards give you the same basic, common and a splash of rare cards.  Even the basic beginner decks cost tens of thousands of ""dust"" to craft.

16835,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,Saddly this has the same problem mtg has for me. your resources are in your deck. i know a lot of people like this but i just cant play a game where i might draw everything i need to play but cant play it cause i didn't draw resources. or i might draw only resources and be god danm useless. yes card games are random but separating resources and decks was the best thing i ever saw and cant bring myself to go back to card games like this.,0
16836,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewGave it five hours. I grinded 5 hours to try and get enough stuff to actually build a deck. You know, a deck with those super powerful cards that♥♥♥♥♥stomp you when you're new.

I got jack♥♥♥♥♥♥to be honest. I took apart every card from every class except commons worth one and the cards I wanted to use in my colors.I still had enough to buy just one exotic thing.

16839,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Early Access ReviewIt's no secret that Eternal is ""inspired"" by Magic: the Gathering. It's sort of flabbergasting just how much is inspired though. This game is so similar that I'm surprised it's even legal.Seriously, can you do that? Can you just take someone else's game, simplify it, give it wooshy graphics, and publish it without getting sued? If so, this is a great career path for anyone interested in game design with no capacity for it.",0
16840,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,Early Access ReviewIt uses the old MTG land system and regeneration after combat. This makes the game basically purely random. You win or loose if you have your golden draw and not your opponent. Very boring.,0

16842,Eternal Card Game,2018.0,"Never thought this is gonna be my first steam comment: As a mid range/control deck player, I hate this game so much, the balance is awful sometimes. I can't stand it any longer as I usually do because the new set of cards is ridiculous.Just pick one card like Avigraft, it is so overpower and overpush, and the influence requirement is low, also the backfire is nothing meaningful AT ALL. One card can can be used as a kill spell and a forever lockdown at 3 mana/power cost only with a slight backfire. Compare to Ciywide Ban, Avigraft is on a completely different power level.Since I don't tend to be a copy(deck) cat/cancer meta deck player, I don't think I will stay in this game if nothing is gonna change.To conclude, this was a good card game with small issues.",0

16844,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewJust bad mtg clone. Fractions and cards are totally unbalanced, everything is luck favored and there a so much random looses (playing 1 match against a deck with just 1 mulligan after witch you have to keep the hand is so poor choice of a game mechanic). It has all the bad design of the magic the gathering and all of ""dumb"" down decision making and grindyness of a hearthstone, basically the worst of both worlds. The freemium model is so bad and ""grind"" and with the random game losses from overfloods or mana screws its useless to try to take it as a serious game. As always this will appeal to brain lazy people but I think hearthstone is much better for them then this. Not recommending this to anybody.",0

The free-to-play campaign is very short and afterward you are left with various ""Gauntlet"", ""Puzzle"", and other dueling opportunities.

All that said, the game, graphics, and play is all very well made.",0
16848,Eternal Card Game,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI put about 25 hours into this game, but now I'm quitting, and I don't recommend you waste your time. Eternal creators don't understand how to balance cards, and legendaries dominate the game. They are also incedibly, incredibly rare. After about 25 hours, I have legendaries for 5% of the original, and 5% of the expansion. And now? Oh now, they decide to update the game to give less prizes. So now instead of winning a silver crate every 3rd ranked win which only nets you a rare anyways, now you get 2 reds, which each one gives you a common. This game is GRIND city and now they are getting greedier.Many of their card creation is just idiotic as well. For instance, there is a cockroach that gives every other cockroach in your hand and deck +1/+1 every time you play it. So there's an entire deck dedicated to just playing a hundred cockroaches over and over and over through copying and bringing it back. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Hey, it's a cockroach! And another! And another! And another! And another! Hey, a cockroach for the 5th and 6th turns in a row! This is a fun game with exciting interactions!!! (/s) And that's when you aren't running into decks that are made of nothing but legendaries, which have no limitations on them. The Eternal creators seem to want to take all the fun out of actually playing the cards, and they don't understand how to design a card game whatsoever. It's a shame, because it was fun for a little while until the flaws became glaringly obvious and prizes were reduced.Oh, and there are plenty of bugs, too. For instance, there's a weapon that gives +*/+* where *=number of justice power you have banked up. It's a weapon that does not give this ability to a creature. But for some reason, when your creature gets silenced, it also silences your weapon (which it's not supposed to do). Think they would fix it in their 3 latest bug fixes? Nope!",0

21506,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewBasically Robocraft is quite a nice game but it really has some issues. Now there are gonna be enough reviews with pros and cons and the likes so let me make this short.There are only 2 reasons this game gets a no from me currently.1. There used to be a time were Rail Helis were, niche, hard to properly create and play but they were fun, and really useful in the right hands too. Your rails were rather unprecise due to the bobbing up and down of the rotor blades, meaning in order to aim properly you had to act against the bob, adding an additional layer of skill to actually play a competitive Rail Heli. Even then you traded some of your accuracy for mobility. Now though, in a real fight you can expect lots of freak misfires that just hit the ground 20 meter away from were the red dot was.(Speaking of which, what the frick do I need a red dot for if it isn't related to the spot I'll be hitting at all? I already have a reticule.)To make this issue weirder, I can't recreate this problem in the training mode at all. 1500ft and I still get 5 out of 6 shots on a target more than half a map away, all while moving up/down AND across the map. Maybe they're caused by being damaged? I don't know, but it's annoying, and the accuracy loss during fights is WAY too big.I still can play my Rail Heli that used to kick♥♥♥♥♥halfway decently, but the constant freak misfires which are not directly my fault AND can't be prevented by anything aside from getting another bot type, are taking a lot of fun out of the game. It just won't feel right. And yeah, that as an airborne player is still a larger issue than flak cannons or the likes to me.2. ""The scores of the winning team have been doubled"" aka ""Carried Scrublord > Exceptional Player on losing team""If just they'd change those 2 things this game would get a full recommendation from me. And I'd sink a lot more time into this game too. As long as those are there... thanks, but no thanks.Edit: 21.06.2016There's a lot of nice new features, like smart weapons and stuff. It's actually quite nice. Aside maybe from whiner acommodation aka flak.And I really want to get hyped again for this game but my personal playing niche has been completely killed off, and since it's still as dead as it gets my review stays negative.",0

21513,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAlright, as you can see I have spent almost 900 hours on this game so I am obviously not new to this but at the current state that this game is in, I would not recommend this game to anyone. I first played when the game was new (i.e. when T2, T4, T6, T8, T10 weapons were called S-Types) on a friends account. This game was perfect for me, fun and engaging gameplay and you needed proper tactics to win. Then we got aerofoils and this was a very important part to this game since before the only type of flying robots were helium drones and you copuld not place plasmas on the bottom so you had to make it so you could flip it around to make a plasma bomber. My favourite period for RC was durong the Walker and Nano update. Nanos were the most important class for a team and often decided the winning team and walkers were very interesting to play with and meant you could explore the entire map and made rails a very interesting opponent. Also, there were still tech points!The last time that RC was enjoyable for me was the ROBOCRAFT Unleashed update. This is the battle arena update which although I thoroughly enjoyed, it made it impossible to get into a TDM game and made Megas redundantAfter this, they removed tiers and tiered blocks, megabots, gc and rp. They added so many new weapons in a short period of time, changed the currency, ruined the economy and made end-game players the exact same as newbies.Also, since GC is gone, all GC only components are now available to everyone. This is bad for me as I had bought EVERY mask, 6x Carbon SMGs, 6x Carbon MSMGs, 2x USA flags, 2x UK flags, 2x Vapour trails (The big ones), 4x Vapour trails (Smaller ones), 4x Speedometers, 2x Altimeters, 10x Vampire Bat wings & rudders (10 of each) and 10x Bat wings & rudders (10 of each). I also had 6 months of premium. What a waste of money this game is. So, in conclusion, this game is a waste of time and a money grab. Thanks FJ for ruining a once amazing and popular game!",0

21518,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe most important thing to know for someone looking to maybe get into this game is that it is in Early Access and despite being in this state for quite some time the developers seem to have lost their vision and moved away from their original ""Design and Fight"" game model to one more conducive to micro-transaction monitization. If you are familiar with the many pay-to-win smartphone games out there, you will find the current Robocraft very familiar.One big down side of this change is that it cripples the original vision of being able to design creative vehicles. The nature of the random loot rewards means you either have to pay (real money) for large amounts of crates ($100 in crates would be a reasonable initial invenstment) so you can get enough of the same type of parts to even have a hope of designing what you want, or you plan on grinding for months with whatever cobbled together frankenstein of a bot you can manage.This isn't to say you cannot sell the unwanted parts for in-game currency to buy the parts you want. The problem is the exchange rate is very, very bad with respect to the cost of the parts (10% - 30%). In addition, the random nature of the drops makes it undesireable to exchange any parts, since you never know when you will need one of them to make a design you just thought up ... or more realistically collect enough matching parts to make a complete bot, ignoring if you wanted to play that type of bot in the first place.For example: movement types are collected one at a time, and you usually need at least 4 to be stable. So you would need to sell 4-5 random movement parts to buy just one of the type you actually wanted. On the other hand, if you kept those movement parts you would be partially along in 2-3 other movment types that you might want to try out later. So you have the choice of sacrificing being able to make multiple bots later for progress on making one bot now. The same goes for weapons, you could sell multiple weapons to buy a single weapon you wanted, but since you need 4-10 weapons per bot you really sacrifice your future ability to create bots if you do that.In conclusion, the game had a lot of initial promise which seems to have been lost in the developers desire to turn it into a pay-to-win smartphone style game. My recommendation is to skip the Early Access stage of this game and wait for the final release of the game to see what the developers actually end up delivering.",0

21522,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI've played this game for over a year and about 600 hours (the standalone launcher isn't tracked by Steam) and spent probably $50 altogether on premium time and cosmetic items.Robocraft used to be good, but then the lead devs started coming to work with their pants on their heads. The Epic Loot update made it virtually impossible to get the robot parts you need to finish your robot, as everything is based on random drops. The game is still plagued by game-breaking bugs (like half the players on a team never connecting) that have been around for over a year.The devs are pretending that nothing's wrong, even though they are hemorrhaging players on a daily basis.Don't waste your time here.

21523,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewGod, How terrible this game has become. This game use to be fun with tiers, and now its chaos. You may look at the time ive played on it and be like ""This guy has not played that long"" But in reality, i have. It was just on my other account, which i no longer have access to. I remember i once spent a week getting money to make my bot, then by the time i finished making it, it was over the max CPU. Apparently the CPU BEFORE what it was currently was higher so the design was perfect. Now, It gets 1shot due to the way its made. Before it could withstand being fired at for a long time due to how it was designed.The devs of this game have gone mad. They think they need more profit. They dont listen to the community. I believe that this game still has the potential to be good again. That is if the developers stop trying to be all about stealing your wallet, and listen to the community. I think any player who has played for awhile can agree that this game is just TERRIBLE now, since you can be selfish and use ANY gun on your bot at one time, and the fact that they removed the pilot chair.Since players can be selfish, they can anything at ALL that they want. Its just unfair. Basically you have to design a bot ready to defend against ANYTHING. Back when the game was great, yeah you had to make your bot ready to defend against anything, although it wasnt as major. You had your team to support you. Now, everybody is just selfish.

21525,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game has definitely changed a lot over the past year.  Everything was originally just a deathmatch with no respawning.  Now it has mini-bases that you must destroy and claim as your own, which then strengthens your main base or something...  I don't know exactly how it works but the point is that if you find the new mode too complicated, you can still go back to the original deathmatch mode.  Everything you see and hear from the trailers above can give you an idea about how it works, with you building your own war machines and stuff, so I won't waste your time.  Really the only downside to this game is the long waiting times to get into a match recently now that so many people are on at once, but I'm sure that will be fixed soon enough.  Oh wait, I haven't said something funny yet.   Sarah Palin!  Now give me 10,000 likes.",1
21526,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game was a lot better back in 2014 but the development team are amatuers at best. Failure to learn from their mistakes (and there are many) which has been proven again and again over the 2 years of updates I've suffered playing this game.Match Making is appaulling and punishes new players and skllled players. The outcome of most games is decided before you start the match which is such poor game design. The problem arose when they lost most of their players with an update back in 2015 (Battle Arena Update) which broke the game (Overclocking mechanic) and reduced the playerbase to a point they started throwing everyone together to speed up the queue times. The removal of tiers was never replaced by a better system, just the same system with more spread on the players it matched together. This relates to the poor match making.Mega Bots were added then removed when they lost interest in developing them. Mega weapons were kept and now present a game balance issue the developers lask the skill to resolve.Failure to add key features for the community like Clans (This could make the game if they bothered to implement it)They treat the players/customers with little consideration when they release major changes. Often these are filled with new bugs and design flaws.They only care about new players who spend real money. Membership exists but it offers such poor value I suspect a smaller than normal percentage of the playerbase has taken up the offer.  If you spend real money on this game be warned anything you buy could be changed from the point of purchase as they change the mechanics of this game at least once a year. Spend only to support the development team who endless changes things and keep the game in Alpha development to excuse them from any real accountibility.The most recent update changed the ingame economy to be primary controlled by opening crates which contain a random item. The items can be converted into ingame currency for a fraction of its price. Effectively you can grind the free to play model, convert the items into currency and progress at a very slow rate or buy the new crates/items for real money at extortionate rates. They have realised only new players spend money on their game so this model maximises what a new player needs to spend if they actually what to compete in the games matched against the vetern players. This game is now looking more like 'free to install' and 'pay to compete'",0

21530,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI hate to have to get on the bandwagon, but the new update is an abomination on one of the most unique and potentially briliant games I've ever played. Loot crates are a terrible system in any game, but putting them in one like this that's focused so strongly on creativity is a joke. They need to go back to a currency based system that rewards players properly instead of at random. If they really feel the need to have one of these asinine ""blind bag"" systems that focus more on exploiting gambling addiction than any sort of fun, it should be secondary to a more reliable system of currency.. like the one they threw out.I'm not sure what goes through the minds of the Robocraft devs, but I've never seen a game flail around so much in terms of its core systems. It's like the whole thing is just an experiment and they have no actual vision for what the game should be. Many of the things they've changed over the years have been improvements, but this one... if anything, it seems like a misguided marketing idea. I deeply hope they come back to what made Robocraft great some day, and stick with it.",0
21531,Robocraft,2016.0,"The updates ruined the game. - Everyone can have up to 5 types of weapons. - Before people had to choose single weapon which determined their class. I enjoyed this limitation, becouse this made everyone be more creative and more into the game. - No tech tree and tiers. - No more progression. Now you may grind, buy a weapon, lose interest, and leave the game, becouse there is no goal anymore. - Crates. Basically copying other games. I know they had financial issues, but that was the wrong choice. They incresed the grind. YAY, they are getting removed at least. - Medics ( previously my favourite class ) overhaul. When classes existed, medics had a pupose. Now everyone regenerates after 10 seconds, so whats the point? And not as satisfying or potent. This is equally important to making damage but the reward is multiple times lesser. - Self healing. Getting shot means less. Dont need to be as careful. Eliminates the need of medics. Lessens roleplay. - Penalties. Most of the time they punish needlessly. The game is buggy and requires perfect internet connection. Nobody has it stable.There are more things done wrong but that is already enough to say that this game which has great potential was reshaped in the wrong way, and now its just not good.>> Main mistake the DEVs made.

You get crates. which give you crap. even the best of crates will give you basic loot. which they claim is ""uncommon"" which is nothing more than the most basic weapons, the old Tier 1 items from when the game had tiers.There is no real progression you just hope you get what you want.There are an assortment of hacks out there for the game which ruins the fun for everyone else, because they can't play.

So I logged in, and slowly my semi-vacant stare was replaced with one of creeping horror. What the blazes was this?!? My lovingly crafted ships had lost 90% of their value that I had worked for, as the heavily armored blocks had been replaced by worthless, all in one designs. ""No big deal. I'll go design something new. Wonder what new parts they have added?"" My look of horror was soon replaced by one of sadness. The unique design systems that had made Robocraft great were gone, replaced by a simple random number generator. I loved to play Robocraft in the past because I could specialize a robot to provide a critical part of the team... but now the designs and balances were gone, forcing all players into this similar, homogeneous sellout of a game.

21539,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewOkay so Robocraft used to be a good game. That is as simple as I can make this. I used to love logging in and building robots and fighting against other people, seeing creativity and combat come together like some brilliant child fantasy of building things out of lego and smashing them together, or whatever. But seriously, what the f*** happened? After about 5 good games of robocraft I could walk away with on average around 200,000 to 500,000 in the game currency and buy loads of cool items and build loads of new robots with crazy designs. BUT. Now it's so disgusting, the entire combat sytem is somewhat still enjoyable, but now, you've got to be so good at the game to get some weird loot reward thing at the end of a match to get items that YOU DON'T EVEN WANT. I think in one game i was rewarded a 'protanium chest' or whatever (which i beleive is the best loot box you can get) and I got absolutely f*** all in it. I sold the crap from the box for abour 2,000 'Robits'. How the hell are new people playing the game supposed to get money to build a robot? I'm stuck with the three worst robots in exsistence and i can't do f*** all about it. I'm struggling to fight againts people who were lucky enough to have a good robot built before this 'apocalype' update occured. This game seriously needs to be fixed, like back to the way it used to be when you could actually get money to upgrade your bots and do well in matches so you can actually have fun. Honestly, the people behind this game are absolute idiots, they need to wake up and realise that what they are doing is putting players off completely. I do not recommend this game AT ALL. However I do recomend that you cry like a baby like me so that we players who USED to love the game can enjoy it once more. Thanks.",0

Regretfully, I am giving up on this game, having no hope for it's future and an unlikely return to it's former glory.I used to love building bots and would spend whole sessions building and testing without ever even getting to the fight, but when I go back now, the only designs that seem particularly effective are hideous.

21544,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewWAS the Awesomenes Construction Simulator 2014. That is what this game WAS. Note that I'm a Tier 9 and have just recently played this game to update my review.I have Built:M-35 Mako from Mass Effect 1M-44 Hammerhead from Mass Effect 2.UT-47A Kodiak from Mass Effect 3.Terran Diamondback from Starcraft 2.Terran Arâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥e Mercenary Siege Tank. (YES. THE SIEGE BREAKER FROM WINGS OF LIBERTY.)But none of that matters when the base physics of the game have been modified from what was established, the weapons continuously nerfed until being 6 feet under, Rewards being lowered with ""Improvments to the system"", and a plethora of other problems.Back in early 2014 I STRONGLY, I repeat, STRONGLY supported this game. STRONGLY, I emphasize this, say it with me. STRONGLY... SUPPORTED THIS GAME. But with every step forward, FreeJam has shown they intend to take two steps back every time.- ""Clone Wars""So let's first start off with the removal of all the nice cool gadgets that were originally available right at the start. This included the Hoverblades, Plasma launchers, Railguns, and thrusters. From level 1 upward of Level 3. Yes, this happened. Freejam didn't change THIS until 7 months later, when people stopped crying and moaning for it to come back.- ""Double Edged Butt-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ery""Now PRIOR to this, they also made some modifications to the reward system, adding a ""Repair function"" to the game, which put a drain on casual players Tiers 6 and up back then. What was the kick in the balls here? a 25% decrease in rewards. Yes, BOTH RP and TP (Robopoints and Techpoints).- ""Hero Zero"" Next up was the ""Hero System"", which allowed you to get the full RP and TP from a match you died in if your team won, but WAIT! ...At the cost of the entire reward system getting another 25% decrease. At this point, managing to make enough money to get new parts was an uphill battle, and at a 50% reward decrease that has remained permanent to this day, It's been a massive pain in theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ - ""Turn up for Hate""Now, next up, THEY REMOVE repair cost, yet YET again, ANOTHER FREAKING REWARD QUANTITY DECREASE. You getting the pattern yet? Don't worry I'll explain it in a second. At this point, it got rediculous, but oh no, there's even MORE. - ""From Intense to Indense""This game was always a One-life team Death Match game. The ""Respawned and Overclocked"" update has killed everything that made it original and turned it into a confused MOBA wannabe. Even worse, is that they've now set the original mode, now named ""Classic"" So far on the back burner it can take from 5 minutes to 3 hours just to get on a match, gradually decreasing the time needed to even get into one with each tier you go up. But here's the final blow to the old mode: A 80% decrease at this point... To the profit you make from it. ""Classic"" is now as worthwhile as dumping yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in a toilet...Or on a development team. Think that's the worst part? Oh no. I'm not even FINISHED. - ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING KEYBOARD!?!""The controls with any movement design other than Tank treads will feel so obliterated you will literally ask... Yeah that's right, the subtitle of this paragraph. As of the R&O Update, Wheels are incredibly sluggish, Rockets provide minimal momentum, hoverblades are highly unstable if you lose even ONE, Aerofoils are a disaster to use, Walker legs are bloody hell to even keep still on a ceiling or a steep hill if you want to stay in place, and believe me, it's going to walk down to the surface on you while you shoot. And LASTLY, the rotor blade design is sluggish as well.THISâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥GENUINELY BRINGS MY P!SS TO A PLASMATIC BOIL. THE CHALLENGE SHOULD NOT BE IN HANDICAPPING THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PLAYER. - ""GIVE US UR MONIES!""Why all the reward debuffs? Because they want money. They want to FORCE THE PLAYERBASE to purchase premium currency so that they can accelerate their growth to a level they can remotely tolerate. This game never DID have a fair free to play model, but it is now skewed beyond any conceivable belief. And also, No, it's not even classified as Pay to Win. IT'S PAY TO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PROGRESS. - ""GIVE US UR MONIES 2!!1""The introduction of Easy Anti Cheat, or EAC. Instead of using Steam's VAC system which worked very well and still mostly does, made no sense either. They decided to use a third party system, that not only people have always second-guessed, but never trusted, and never been comfortable with. You see where this is going? Yeah. They drove off a number of their player base stating, ""If you can't get into Robocraft to play because of EAC, that is a small price to pay for the issue of Hackers trying to ruin our game"". The only people who tried to help fix this was EAC themselves as I recall, and even THEN, only under the pressure of the Robocraft community, which had already started leaving. - ""GIVE US UR FERKIGN MUNEEZ!!11!ELEVEN!""WHY did EAC have to fix it? Because Freejam was too dumbfounded watching the stars shine out of their fat frigging assh0les to do it themselves, aside from the matter of the development company's profoundly horrendous inexperience in stopping hackers in the first place. But it doesn't even end there. They won't respond to crticism kindly, light or dark, which is why i'm not sugarcoating this. Not even an ounce. They won't listen to reason, no matter how kindly you put it. If they don't like yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you better be prepared for the ban hammer, because they silence ANY AND ALL FEEDBACK that involves any kind of actual review with a VENGEANCE. And hell, this hasn't even ended yet. Keep reading. This is starting to look like the Robocraft Holocaust. *shudder* - ""Nerf 'em to the Grave""Now, the FINAL kick to the balls here, and you might not get up from this one, is the repeated nerfing of weapons that have performed perfectly fine, and the buffing of weapons that never even needed a buff. FINALLY, there's the issue of rendering certain vehicular designs completely obsolete, promoting the uncreative design of Gun Bricks with tank treads, and tank treads only. I'll give an example. - ""From Speedy to Needy""I made a vehicle called ""The Masterkill B@stard"" (Frankly can't put the word itself in) Which operated on two things: Wheels + downforce, and rocket asssisted forward momentum. As of 3 days after the R&O update, my speedy little vehicle is no faster than a Treaded Tank, and that's WITH the thrusters on. I guess people can't stand having to exercize their arms, hands and fingers with the corsshairs on their Railguns and enjoy the game, because this actually happened. WITHOUT rockets, it's even SLOWER than a tank. Believe me, i've tested this one the day I learned of the horror inflicted on the Physics engine, which I think it's safe to say, it's nearly nonexistant now. - ""Final Thoughts""Lastly, like i said, I STRONGLY... STRONGLY! SUPPORTED THIS GAME! Hell, I even put $10 into this game just for hangar bays! But as of now? FreeJam has botched their game so much, yielded to the manipulation of their own community so badly, that it is nigh-unenjoyable. This game had SO MUCH POTENTIAL a year ago. But now it's all been dried up. Freejam has made it evidently clear they don't want to take a step in the right direction. A year ago, i'd give this game a 9.5 out of 10. But as of now, I can only - in good conscience - give it a 4 out of 10. A toxic community, confused development team, nonsensical gameplay, poor teamplay or constant nerfs as a double-edge to updates, and absolutely horrible physics engine tortured to death by modification of what it once was, ALL IN THE NAME, of staying away from making the game overall better simple for personal profit, keeps me from daring touch this awful nightmare any more after this. Stay. Away. From this hideous deformed child of a game. You will be stricken with it's Gods-awful MOBA wannabe gameplay.[More on my Review in the Comments section]",0

THE SIEGE BREAKER FROM WINGS OF LIBERTY.)But none of that matters when the base physics of the game have been modified from what was established, the weapons continuously nerfed until being 6 feet under, Rewards being lowered with ""Improvments to the system"", and a plethora of other problems.Back in early 2014 I STRONGLY, I repeat, STRONGLY supported this game. STRONGLY, I emphasize this, say it with me. STRONGLY... SUPPORTED THIS GAME. But with every step forward, FreeJam has shown they intend to take two steps back every time.- ""Clone Wars""So let's first start off with the removal of all the nice cool gadgets that were originally available right at the start. This included the Hoverblades, Plasma launchers, Railguns, and thrusters. From level 1 upward of Level 3. Yes, this happened. Freejam didn't change THIS until 7 months later, when people stopped crying and moaning for it to come back.- ""Double Edged Butt-♥♥♥♥ery""Now PRIOR to this, they also made some modifications to the reward system, adding a ""Repair function"" to the game, which put a drain on casual players Tiers 6 and up back then. What was the kick in the balls here? a 25% decrease in rewards. Yes, BOTH RP and TP (Robopoints and Techpoints).- ""Hero Zero"" Next up was the ""Hero System"", which allowed you to get the full RP and TP from a match you died in if your team won, but WAIT! ...At the cost of the entire reward system getting another 25% decrease. At this point, managing to make enough money to get new parts was an uphill battle, and at a 50% reward decrease that has remained permanent to this day, It's been a massive pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ - ""Turn up for Hate""Now, next up, THEY REMOVE repair cost, yet YET again, ANOTHER FREAKING REWARD QUANTITY DECREASE. You getting the pattern yet? Don't worry I'll explain it in a second. At this point, it got rediculous, but oh no, there's even MORE. - ""From Intense to Indense""This game was always a One-life team Death Match game. The ""Respawned and Overclocked"" update has killed everything that made it original and turned it into a confused MOBA wannabe. Even worse, is that they've now set the original mode, now named ""Classic"" So far on the back burner it can take from 5 minutes to 3 hours just to get on a match, gradually decreasing the time needed to even get into one with each tier you go up. But here's the final blow to the old mode: A 80% decrease at this point... To the profit you make from it. ""Classic"" is now as worthwhile as dumping your♥♥♥♥♥in a toilet...Or on a development team. Think that's the worst part? Oh no. I'm not even FINISHED. - ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY ♥♥♥♥ING KEYBOARD!?!""The controls with any movement design other than Tank treads will feel so obliterated you will literally ask... Yeah that's right, the subtitle of this paragraph. As of the R&O Update, Wheels are incredibly sluggish, Rockets provide minimal momentum, hoverblades are highly unstable if you lose even ONE, Aerofoils are a disaster to use, Walker legs are bloody hell to even keep still on a ceiling or a steep hill if you want to stay in place, and believe me, it's going to walk down to the surface on you while you shoot. And LASTLY, the rotor blade design is sluggish as well.THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥GENUINELY BRINGS MY P!SS TO A PLASMATIC BOIL. THE CHALLENGE SHOULD NOT BE IN HANDICAPPING THE ♥♥♥♥ING PLAYER. - ""GIVE US UR MONIES!""Why all the reward debuffs? Because they want money. They want to FORCE THE PLAYERBASE to purchase premium currency so that they can accelerate their growth to a level they can remotely tolerate. This game never DID have a fair free to play model, but it is now skewed beyond any conceivable belief. And also, No, it's not even classified as Pay to Win. IT'S PAY TO ♥♥♥♥ING PROGRESS. - ""GIVE US UR MONIES 2!!1""The introduction of Easy Anti Cheat, or EAC. Instead of using Steam's VAC system which worked very well and still mostly does, made no sense either. They decided to use a third party system, that not only people have always second-guessed, but never trusted, and never been comfortable with. You see where this is going? Yeah. They drove off a number of their player base stating, ""If you can't get into Robocraft to play because of EAC, that is a small price to pay for the issue of Hackers trying to ruin our game"". The only people who tried to help fix this was EAC themselves as I recall, and even THEN, only under the pressure of the Robocraft community, which had already started leaving. - ""GIVE US UR FERKIGN MUNEEZ!!11!ELEVEN!""WHY did EAC have to fix it? Because Freejam was too dumbfounded watching the stars shine out of their fat frigging assh0les to do it themselves, aside from the matter of the development company's profoundly horrendous inexperience in stopping hackers in the first place. But it doesn't even end there. They won't respond to crticism kindly, light or dark, which is why i'm not sugarcoating this. Not even an ounce. They won't listen to reason, no matter how kindly you put it. If they don't like your♥♥♥♥♥ you better be prepared for the ban hammer, because they silence ANY AND ALL FEEDBACK that involves any kind of actual review with a VENGEANCE. And hell, this hasn't even ended yet. Keep reading. This is starting to look like the Robocraft Holocaust. *shudder* - ""Nerf 'em to the Grave""Now, the FINAL kick to the balls here, and you might not get up from this one, is the repeated nerfing of weapons that have performed perfectly fine, and the buffing of weapons that never even needed a buff. FINALLY, there's the issue of rendering certain vehicular designs completely obsolete, promoting the uncreative design of Gun Bricks with tank treads, and tank treads only. I'll give an example. - ""From Speedy to Needy""I made a vehicle called ""The Masterkill B@stard"" (Frankly can't put the word itself in) Which operated on two things: Wheels + downforce, and rocket asssisted forward momentum. As of 3 days after the R&O update, my speedy little vehicle is no faster than a Treaded Tank, and that's WITH the thrusters on. I guess people can't stand having to exercize their arms, hands and fingers with the corsshairs on their Railguns and enjoy the game, because this actually happened. WITHOUT rockets, it's even SLOWER than a tank. Believe me, i've tested this one the day I learned of the horror inflicted on the Physics engine, which I think it's safe to say, it's nearly nonexistant now. - ""Final Thoughts""Lastly, like i said, I STRONGLY... STRONGLY! SUPPORTED THIS GAME! Hell, I even put $10 into this game just for hangar bays! But as of now? FreeJam has botched their game so much, yielded to the manipulation of their own community so badly, that it is nigh-unenjoyable. This game had SO MUCH POTENTIAL a year ago. But now it's all been dried up. Freejam has made it evidently clear they don't want to take a step in the right direction. A year ago, i'd give this game a 9.5 out of 10. But as of now, I can only - in good conscience - give it a 4 out of 10. A toxic community, confused development team, nonsensical gameplay, poor teamplay or constant nerfs as a double-edge to updates, and absolutely horrible physics engine tortured to death by modification of what it once was, ALL IN THE NAME, of staying away from making the game overall better simple for personal profit, keeps me from daring touch this awful nightmare any more after this. Stay. Away. From this hideous deformed child of a game. You will be stricken with it's Gods-awful MOBA wannabe gameplay.[More on my Review in the Comments section]",0

21547,Robocraft,2017.0,"a long time ago the game was fun and simple. To be honest when they reworked a lot of the mechanics and transitioned it over to a loot crate system I still had fun with the game. I knew the loot crates were cash grabs but if you won games and did well you got good crates. log in daily get a protonium crate. You still get♥♥♥♥♥♥ even at the bare minimum of taking 2 minutes out of your day to load the game up and close it again.But I came back to the game the other day here after not having played in a long time. The 8v8 or whatever game mode with the towers and the map variety is gone. all that is left is a 5v5 game mode on the same claustraphobic map that i never liked to begin with. It doesn't have towers that you shoot, just cap points you sit on. The enemy base isn't your target, you jut cap and wait for time. It's not fun anymore. At least when the loot crates were first introduced it was still fun to play. Yeah getting legendary equipment took a while if you didn't get extremely lucky, but you didn't need it to have a decent bot and have fun.",0
21548,Robocraft,2018.0,"It's fun, sure. But when they switched from a tier system to a lootcrate system I lost almost my entire setup, and the arena became very unbalanced. I do NOT enjoy the pay to win system, nor am I glad to see it in Robocraft. I'm disappointed Freejam",1
21549,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI first played this many months ago and decided to give it a try tonight, only to find they have added ""EasyAntiCheat"" as a requirement. While I get that client side anti-cheat software can be useful and seems to have been needed based on forum posts, I have considerable privacy concerns based on what EAC is requesting it be allowed to do on my computer.The software itself has full access to screenshot, keylog and google searches have shown the results are publicly available for all to see. The only limiting factor is their word that it only operates while the game is running. While I'm sure there is other anti-cheat software running on my computer (ie steam), the data it returns to any third party servers has never been Google searchable.I recommend the developers for Robocraft force a migration of their users to Steam and use Steam's built in anti-cheat instead of using a third party app developer who obviously has zero clue on how to secure data being returned to their servers. There's no excuse for that to be Google searchable.",0
21550,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI really used to like this game. I would, as many did, recommend this game to my friends, telling them that it was really fun and a cool little buildy game. It had a free-to-play aspect, but I was OK with that. I even gave the developers some money and bought some items. I now wish that I had saved my money. This game has, like many of my bots, been flown into the ground at a rapid rate after several of the important bits have been taken away. It used to be that you would build a robot of a certain tier, and would be matched with similar robots. Hearing complaints about how you could exploit the ranking system, they attempted to balance it, but it was a crap method of doing so: by completely removing the system. At this point, I stopped playing for a while. I came back to this game, hearing of a new update, and they had in fact removed features. You didn't need a pilot's seat, armor had been completely...""reworked,"" and they had made glass, which was SUCH A COOL-LOOKING BLOCK, into a freakin' cosmetic item! And the only way to get cosmetic items is with real money. Oh, did I mention that MOST COLORS OF PAINT YOU NEED TO PAY FOR?!*sigh* VERDICT:If Freejam pulls their act together, I would heartily recommend this game. However, in its current state, I would say hold off.",0
21551,Robocraft,2015.0,Early Access ReviewThe developers have shown again and again a great example of how to take a really good game and drive it into the ground. I used to recommend this to many friends but after having more and more features removed I am left with no feeling of progression or achievement.Do the developers care about the game? Probably. But in reality it just feels like they are trying to swap the game out from under our feet. I used to invest my time into improving my robot and be really excited to try out a new part but now it's only good for a quick round of shooting things where most of the bots are just the same design. Creativity is gone. Originality is gone. Excitement is gone.This is not the game I supported in the past. It's still a fun game in some ways but be cautious about how attached you get to it. They might decide robots are not what they want in the game anymore and continue making it less unique by turning it into a FPS. It wouldn't suprise me if they did.Oh and if you do play it you should know this. When it says press left shift... they mean right. And while this isn't really a big deal it does describe my opinion on the direction this game is going. Backwards.Disclaimer: I am probably being a little harsh on the game but when you get crapped time after time then it kind of hurts your opinion.,0
21552,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game was fantastic. The developers constantly make bad changes and refuse to listen to their player base on the most simple of issues. If your wanting to build robots and enjoy the game you literally have to rely on RNG to get the parts you need. It isn't fun and has severaly damaged the game.The developers have shown a really bad attitude towards everyone {LINK REMOVED}https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FRobocraft%2Fcomments%2F4h68nd%2Fsebify_boring_reviews_on_steam_by_who_doesnt%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHg74ipPV2TE1o36Jp3WmzqzhQMMwAnd it doesn't appear to be getting any better.

Then there was another update, so i played it and i was like oh, this is S**T!!!!!! WHY THE H*LL WOULD THEY ADD THIS DUMB A** POWDER SYSTEM, THE DEVELOPERS MUST HAVE BEEN SNORTING SOME POWDER IF THEY THOUGHT GETTING RID OF THE MONEY AND ADDING SOME CRAFTING POWDER WAS A GOOD IDEA.Message to the developers: if you want to make a good game, that is fun and have players enjoying it, don't get greedy, please get rid of the whole pay to win thing and bring back the original formula, please and thank you",0

21557,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI really enjoyed this game. I spent entirely too many hours playing this game over the past few years and I truly loved it.One of the things that makes such an amazing multiplayer game like this is a healthy relationship between the developers, and their community.Freejam recognizes this, clearly, because in the introduction to their product, they make the claim, “Robocraft has been built with a dedicated community of Robocrafters from the very beginning.""Unfortunately, it seems like they recently replaced someone within their company that has absolutely no respect for their community, or has no desire to retain their existing players.I was already extraordinarily upset when they removed megabots. That was a big deal to me because I had 4 custom megabots which I spent countless hours building. They were the game to me... when Freejam removed them (read: DELETED) overnight, I was shocked.After a week or so, I got over it and rebuilt some bots and resumed playing, albeit a bit more reserved.This latest update took my disdain for change to another degree and completely removed my currency entirely, both of them. I had over 200 million RP, and now it's gone. I had $20 worth of their premium currency saved, gone.My compensation for this loss was a crate which had some white blocks in it.No apology, no words of solace or anything which might remotely comfort me and worst of all, no explanation in game.The fact is, these people have no regard for their community whatsover. They further have no regard for their time, or efforts. They simply don't care. Plain and simple. They care about one thing.Money. More specifically, yours. The individual reading this review debating about whether or not they should install it and give it a shot.Go for it. Install it, love it, build your dream robots and have a great time. It's a really fun game.Unfortunately, for me (and thousands of others by the look of it) I'm done. I've spent far to many hours only to have my efforts tossed aside with zero regard.No consideration for their existing players.I quit.",0
21558,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewOne of the best if not the best free to play game I have ever played. After the first couple hours of playing I bought som in game GC just to support the devs for making this great game. You can craft your own robot and earn points through battling to unlock and buy new tech/weapons/shields/armor and cubes to build your ultimate battle robot. A must play game for everyone considering its FREE. Also very well balanced and in no way pay to win, you can unlock and build almost anything without putting money in the game, the only thing money can really get you is early block unlocks and cosmetics like flags. But they then still have to purchase the blocks after unlocking with earned in game curreency which you cannot buy but only get by playing rounds. GREAT GAME EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT AT LEAST ONCE!",1

21561,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access Review[MY OPINION]In short, I will no longer recommend this game. Bad updates, very very bad support - (No Email support aparently)The game is ruined in my opinion. They removed all the fun. Grinding is no longer a thing of what it seems like. I've spend more than 70h on getting ""Tier stars"" to unlock the whole Tech tree. It's gone.And did i mention my money that i spend on Tier 10 Blocks? It's gone. Thanks Freejam. A bunch of scammers is what they are.Robocraft is no more. The ""new"" Robocraft is hilariously bad. I played this game back when Freejam was on fire and did a very good job of development. However. All this changed. Freejam is now basicly milking every single drop of money they can before this game will die.Freejam, if you see this. Give me my money back.

21562,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe new 'reward' system has ruined the game in it's entirety. Getting crates on victory or defeat is a nice concept, but there are multiple issues with this. - It removes all sense of progression as progression is based solely on luck.- It encourages hindering teammates as players with higher scores get better crates; I.E getting points from capping towers that are almost capped, is far greater than doing it yourself.- The item sell values make it near impossible to actually aquire items from the shop without massive ammounts of grinding.- Premium users can no longer pay real money to get the items they want, and can only gamble on crates to hope they get the items they want.- The premium users getting double the items from crates is a decent concept, but showing the players what they missed out on because they didn't put money into your game, even if they have in past (And got burned on it because of the recent changes) is just cruel.I played this game for a while before the recent overhaul, had quite a few high-tier blocks and high-tier weapons, the former of which cost quite a lot of ingame currency, only to get recycled into normal cubes with no refund to the player, meaning the amount of time I spend prior to the change was completely pointless, save for aquiring levels translating to more CPU. In summary; the recent overhaul screwed over a number players, myself included, the only progression available is that of pot luck, and has never been more pay-to-win, with premium users getting double the chances at items meaning they can get epics and legendaires more readily available (in addition to being able to sell said items for their higher values to get the items they want, far sooner than normal players.)",0
21563,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI tried to like Robocraft. I really did, but too much of this game is money-oriented. The game mechanics were very unique and quite interesting, but you get new items randomly out of crates. I, as a long-time TF2 player, do not have a problem with this, but again, as a long-time TF2 player, I don't like how getting more powerful weapons faster means spending money. Premium? Money! You want another crate without playing? Money! You want to buy your weapons? MONEY!Being a new player, what really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off was how unbalanced the items vs levels system was. Sure, to put more items on your robot meant needing a higher level (somewhat indirectly), but that's about where that ends. You could buy, say, a target-locking missile launcher, and one or two rotor blades, and there you go! BEST ON THE SERVER.I find that fact a little depressing, especially since all this means I could've enjoyed the game a bit more if I had some money to spend on it, but I don't.I don't know what I was expecting. Another good F2P game? Of course not. What I get is this mess of a game. Robocraft isn't worth your time. At least until they fix all the flaws in the game provided by things like the Epic Loot update. Seriously, just look at some of the other bad reviews.",0
21564,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI use to like this game, but not anymore. They redid all the weapons based off of one weapon, and in my opinion, ruined all that was good about them. Skill doesn't seem to matter anymore as anyone can kill you with a few hits. Since any bot can have ALL the weapons on it at a time, it has become who fire the first shot instead of trying to outsmart your enemy with distance and weapon type. Teamwork doesn't seem to matter anymore either. Thats probably the main thing I dislike. My friends and I all agree that lack of team work has made it less fun. Use to, you would have to work with ur teammates to win a match. Now any bot can kill all enemies. It just who fires the first shot.",0

21576,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game was really fun. Until the update came around. Now you get things from drops. You get the currency by selling the things from the drops. This game was one of my go-to games, now I don't even know what to say about it.--UPDATE--This game had some serious potential before. Tiers made games fun as you would play with people with around the same weapons so you wouldn't get 1 shot. Currency wasn't impossible to come by. And everybody could get to the same weapons. Now it's down to if you get a good enough drop which you can sell to get a decent weapon. The devs pretty much saying, ""You want a lot of currency? Either sell your soul to this game or pay us for the currency."" FreeJam went straight money hungry with no regard to what the community is saying.",0
21577,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewI used to like this game until the last update. It started to go downhill on the previous update with the unbalanced weapons (read: ion distorter). Now all that made Robocraft great and a good progression (getting better and better items) has now been undone and we're left with a gamble at the end of each match. It used to be really something to get a bonus of RP (the item currency before Robits) when winning. Now it's a random grind.I actually put real money into this and was somewhat annoyed when the higher level stuff I bought got turned into RP or made obsolete by the previous update.I can no longer recommend the game to others like I've done in the past. Pity that FreeJam decided to ruin things.,0
21578,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game has been going downhill ever since the ""maximum loadout"" update that made everyone turn their bots into a One Bot Army and killed most of the teamwork aspects. Now, with their ""epic loot"" update, they've completely killed the game. You get ""reward crates"" for winning matches which typically give you garbage, like a single wheel, a single gun (when you need 10 for them to be useful), or a small handful of building blocks that won't be the kind you need. There's a recycling system to reuse garbage loot you're given, but the return rates are so low that it's useless.The devs censor their forums and don't accept any criticism of their updates because they spent a long time on it. All they care about is selling premium, selling useless crates, and having high new player counts. They don't care about anyone who's been playing their game longer than a month. Unless you enjoy someone attempting to milk as much cash out of you as they can in a short period of time before they discard you, don't even bother playing.",0

Had tons of weapons in storage because I liked to swap and build different bots, now they are useless because I have to re-craft things I already paid for before?Not to mention the total dumbing down of game mechanics has made this such a boring game to play.No thanks, I am done with this game unless they fix it.",0
21580,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI must admit I was really suprized to see all the negitive remarks about this once great game how ever they are all right they have completly screwed this game up. Progression is completly gone. They have turned this game in to a complete pile of crap.After playing a few matchs over the last month too add: The game has 0 balance, game breaking bugs that have yet to be fixed. Pay to win heavy... And laggy as heck..... DO NOT GIVE THESE GREEDY DEVS ANYTHING TILL THEY FIX THIS PILE OF JUNKAs of July 10th Nope just nope. Let the id10ts suport this trash. There is no balance at all level 20s going up aginst level 100 bots lol, pointless. I started a new account just to test to see what kind of bots I ran into, by the time I hit level 20 I was going up aginst bots the size of my main account (each level you get more cpu, more cpu equals bigger stronger parts). Which is 100 (150 is cap). Weapons that basicly one shot you over and over and over. The only thing the match maker does is put player in a game this is no tier or level grouping, no balance at all. Then theres the weapons, lol Teslas are a noobs best friend require 0 skill and basicly instal kill anything they run into and of course don't forget the lag your dead before you even see what hits you. I am so very sad this is the current state of this game. The devs have decided that a Pay-2-Win model is better as well as not even tring to balance anything. If you want to bang your head on you desk over and over and over by all means install this game. If you like being constanly pitted aginst bots that take your entire team to kill(while your whole team is destroyed)install this game.

21582,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewRobocraft is a really cool idea, build a vehicle from bits and battle it out.  Feels like playing with lego and pretending to have battles.. but for real.  Pretty great.But much of the fun is having pieces to play with, and being able to stick a whole bunch of em together. I do hope the devs read this, I know its one amongst the storm though.They have consistantly tried to monetize in some way, but I think have fallen short.  Unfortunately the easiest way is to put pieces behind some sort of pay wall, experience, credits, tech tree, whatever.  As well as have some sort slow progression like we see with the CPU here.I understand the need for money, the game doesnt exist without it, but the way its currently set up is less fun than it used to be, to the point where I dont play anymore.If it were up to me, all ""default"" parts for free and charge for absolutely everything cosmetic, if that means premium to access  cosmetic parts/paint or pay for singles, however.  No levels, no tech tree, no crates, just big tubs of lego and a battleground, you want paint, or a fancy head or a flag or whatever, money.  I understand many people enjoy the whole progression thing though so... not likely I guess.  Maybe CPU tied to level?  Fixes underCPUing with big parts against low stocked people but still provides a progression of some kind.  Then let me pay to max my level?  I'd pay for that, wouldnt be pay to win because I wouldnt actually have any advantages over those people who didnt pay. (cpu matched against cpu, everyone has all parts) I'd pay for paint colors.. more paint options (seperate cubes into 4 for painting maybe) I'd pay to look ""cool"", however that might work out.   And I have paid to get through some of the progression, but again would appreciate a cut the leveling option and let me max out my level for 30 bucks, or 25 cents a level or something.  I want to play the game-game, not mess around with everything that gets tacked onto the game as if its supposed to somehow enrich my experience.. tech tree/xp/levels, earning and shopping, crates.The problem is this.. right now I have a hard time recommending it to anyone, I dont anymore unless I think the game would really fit that person.  When I have in the past, to everyone I could, they last awhile, but got tired playing with the same small pool of parts and small vehicles...  For me again, building a big cool vehicle is at least half the fun, and blowing off large bits of enemy robots while bits of me fly off is up there too.. doesnt happen much at low cpu.  I imagine retention of new players is on the lower side.  Maybe 20 or so gamer acquaintances have tried it, I thought most would like it... but only 3-4 ever played more than a few days, and only 1 other I think really got into it enough to spend a few bucks. Maybe the devs feel like the game needs value, like if the parts arent ""worth"" anything, if players dont need to grind to build big bots, then the game isnt tangible enough or something?  Did they get a consultant or come up with the idea that ""If you dont value your own work no one will"" Or something like that?  I really really REALLY liked this game, I probably spent as long playing it with the independant client as I have on steam.  I would have spent more money on it.The recentish gameplay changes... Im mixed on, variety is nice with the weapons, but there are valid issues with them I guess, never felt like they really ""ruined"" the game though... Just changed things.  Not a fan of the single block choice now though at all.  Like more CPU but dont like leveling.  Auto self heal feels really wrong.I do feel like some of these changes were made for primary financial rather than gameplay reasons, whether thats attracting peoplem, I mean game needs people right, could argue thats gameplay but.. cmon...  Or encouraging current players to spend more.  The crates drop thing feels like a total gimmick aimed at attracting people that play other crate focused games.  Its the crate thing that really motivated me to give a thumbs down and not play anymore.  The armour thing.. I dont know.. ok?  Feels like a gimmick again with the rewards. I dunno, I dont have a real thought out solution, all I know right now is I want to play robocraft, but not this robocraft.  Hearing the same thing from the couple I know that liked it enough to play occasionally.  So Im not going to be giving them any money, or talking it up a ton... which I imagine isnt going to help the bottom line, and thats the whole problem here isnt it?I dont want to give this game a thumbs down, it deserves a thumbs up, it really does.",0
21583,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewRobocraft...........I can only say that it is among the single most fun mmo I have ever played. I have played alot of mmo's and they all suffer from the same thing.....Best Builds. A build or a set of builds that can beat all others in pvp and pve. Robocraft does not have this. Some builds are better then others in one thing and crappy in another. It is very much up to the player to decide how they want to play and while you can grab a tutorial or buy a bot (the pay to get bots are usually really crappy and serve mostly as a fun cosmetic thing rather than a viable build to play) there is trillions of ways to build a bot. I am almost in tier 10 myself and i have seen planes with wheels or cruisers that can hover. Tanks with legs and so much more.While there aren't many play modes each battle is different. One battle you will get utterly crushed and the next the timer click to 0 because you were too evenly matched and got a long battle. The variations in bots and tactics make it very fun. The devs are polite kind and helpful. Ususally offering a day of free premium every once in awhile. If the servers crash they work tirelessly to get them back up. They care about the players and seem pretty determined to avoid a pay 2 win model.But don't take my word for it, go in there and play fr yourself.......be warned though you will probably get addicted to it.",1
21584,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI once played this game called Robocraft. I found it through a friend of mine and quicly got addicted to it. Playing the battles with completly different robots and weapons was amazing, seeing people use planes either as bombers or as fighters was just something that inspired me to actually reach lvl 80. The spider legs update, AMAZING. So cool to crawl a wall and shoot down stuff. Spider legs with wings? AWESOME! I loved it because it was a grinding game, something that took skill either to construct or fight enemies. I really had much fun. But then, the worst update of all times came. All the time I took to get to level 80, wasted. Because they introduced crates. CS:GO, LoL, OW, those are games that you win cases to have cosmetics and stuff, but this, no. Before if I wanted to buy lets say, a new pair of laser guns, I would have to play max of 5 matches, depending on the way that you played, if you had a good score, if you helped win the game. Now when you do all of those good stuff, you only earn a higher probability crate. Probability, so you can still get sh*t loot from it. It's completly pay to progress. It's embarrasing how such a good game became a pile of complete utter sh*t.Please read your reviews. The really long ones that tell you what's good and wrong in this game. If you do that you'll see your player count rising up again. Make this game great again.",0
21585,Robocraft,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewI seriously love this game and with the new patch nobody can say, that this game is ""pay to win"" (it wasn't even before). I spend lots of time with this game and I am now in tier 7. I haven't paid any money yet but I am considering because the game brought me lots of joy. It is not only about the PvP part but also about the building part, trying to make the best out of your bot. There are 4 different classes of weapons which make it quiet interesting. In the first two tiers it can sometimes be a little frustrating, especially if you don't have a good design but that should only make you wanna build a better one ;)For everybody who like PvP this is a must-try and for everybody who wants to find the engineer inside himself, it is too :)",1

The countless games I'm winning League and boom..disconnected...ALLTHETIME..the amount of times where I get put on an unbalanced team and half of them d/c or leave...ALLTHETIME...The physics feel weird when you can spend AGES building your dream bot and someone comes into a game literally just as boxes or the ""outline"" of a plane etc with guns on them or bullish designs that aerodynamically do not make sense yet are doing better than your fine tuned machine making you wish you were never born!!!!!!(ok not that far but dayyyyum) get your stuff together FJ Nerf these lame brained bots that didnt take any effort and that do not make sense.While although I would recommend this game to new players after they've mastered Minecraft (hah) I would urge all other veteran players to pick up Heroine Hero from their local Babbages (ok i'm dreaming) and just succumb to the fact that this game does not make sense. I have to play multiplayer on Call of Duty just to unwind from how upset I get from seeing the crap these developers are pulling with this game.

21588,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is alright, but not good.I have multiple problems with the game that might just be there forever, and some they've just added make the problems even worse. A big problem is not being able to connect to single player, and how the new expansion works. I just hate how this game turned into a pay to win factory and people still play it! Before you could buy the items you wanted, but now you have to buy ""crates,"" which are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They obviously just want more money.. and more!I don't mind the gameplay. It's got some cool mechanics that they improved, but the almost recent update getting rid of tiers of armour, blocks, and weapons just made the game bad. The energy systems are alright in my opinon, and the new guns too, but if you really want them you would have to spent so much money on these pay to win crates or ""Plotonium"" crates.All in all this game is OK but it has alot of faults that REALLY need to be fixed.",0
21589,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewDo NOT get this game. WOW!It has only gotten worse and worse. Back in 2014 Everything was fantastic! We had a cool tech tree that inspired all players to keep playing, building, battling, and creating. There use to be a bunch of good game mechanics and the play was addicting and would keep you satisfied foralmost every battle. Since then, A lot has changed. Everyone was excited when we heard we would get new weapons and better parts, but there were some changes to how much RP (Robo Points) you could get from winning. The changes kept coming, with each update going one step forward and three steps back. Back in the good days, there were various tiers of blocks, with the higher tier blocks having more health than the previous tier. Those had good things and bad things, but for the most part they were good. (Each tier of block would be a different color, essentially meaning the ""paint"" that we have now was all free and you didn't have to buy premium to get cool colors.) The update back in the winter of 2015 changed a LOT. With the various block tiers gone, the MILLIONS of RP that I had spent on Strong&Healthy™ blocks had all gone to wast, WITH NO REFUND! I could also get into the ranking system. It used to be great, allowing for higher tier items to go into lower tiers, wich allowed for more fun. Even though it may sound ""unfair"" it would not be an effective strategy for actuall combat. This system worked well and rank was built around each weapon having a different Robo score. But as with all good things in Robocraft, that was removed. And instead, it was replaced by a system that still had tiers, but wasn't as fun. Adding restrictions to a Creative game is just something that doesn't ever work out too well. Eventually the tier system was abolished and replaced with a system that puts you in a match with robots that have a similar overall robot level. That was nothing compared to what it has turned into now. Now, The tech tree idea has been trashed and instead replaced by a rarety system with crates. This new update completely killed robocraft. (as if the other updates hadn't done enough damage already) The game is no longer based around skill or experience, it is PURE LUCK. You used to be able to get new items by buying them off the shop with the RP you had earned by battling, (the better you did the more you earned) but now, the only way you will be able to get your hands on that nice Plasma Cannon is by opening a crate and praying that you get it. And as others Have said, The current game, as it stands, is purely luck based.Well FreeJam ill give it to you, You sure do know how to ruine a great game!TL;DRThe game now suckspoint system has gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥br>No longer an insentive to playALL LUCK, NO SKILLDon't waste your time on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameused to be fantastic game but♥♥♥♥♥♥♥devs killed it this just shows how much the devs don't care. https://twitter.com/sebify/status/726373014854615040FUN FACT!All the cool building they are doing in the trailer/video are with the old version, when it didn't suck as bad!",0

I can't recommend this to anyone since the game isn't what I remember it to be that kept me playing it.",0
21595,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access Reviewjust quoting another review i totaly agree with. ""Stay away from this game. Simply put, the development team (FreeJam) is utterly incompetent. There have been so many points in time where the game could have become significantly better with a few minor changes here and there (primarily related to rebalancing weapons/components or various quality of life changes). Instead, FreeJam ignores those high-impact low-hanging fruit, and instead decides to flip the entire game on its head and release major updates that change everything in a big way. This accomplishes nothing other than introducing a multitude of new problems, while rarely addressing those issues that could have been easily fixed. Sure, during the course of the coming weeks and months, FreeJam will slowly but surely resolve some of the screw-ups they made during their last update, until the game once again gets to that point where it could be great with just a few small changes...but then the cycle repeats itself and as expected, just on the horizon is another game breaking update.Other major issues with the game:1) Building/engineering used to be a major component of the game, and high level players used to take pride in their building skills. Nowadays, building skill is hardly worth anything anymore. Any new player can slap something together in 5 minutes and compete toe-to-toe against a bot that took hours to complete. In fact, don't even bother building anything, because within weeks, FreeJam will render your bot utterly useless by breaking it. Either they'll nerf your movement or make various components 10 times heavier, etc. Regardless of how they break it, just be ready to say goodbye to your favorite bots, as they won't be able to perform nearly as well as they once did ""because FreeJam said so.""2) Significant weapon imbalances and easy-mode weapons. Simply put, FreeJam rarely gets weapon balance 100% right, or even close to it. In the current state of the game, there are weapons that are grossly overpowered, and there are weapons that are grossly underpowered. There are also weapons that take little to no skill to use, and yet have been high-impact weapons previously (a new patch attempted to address some of these issues, but the jury is still out). 3) FreeJam doesn't care about players who have been around for years, players with thousands of hours in the game, players who have been active and have helped spread the word about the game. They won't listen to your feedback, no matter how good it is or how well-written it is. Instead, FreeJam does its own thing, with a bias towards catering to new players. Basic things that the competitive/veteran community has been requesting for years...still not here. Things like clans have been ""on FreeJam's radar"" since mid-2014 or earlier - and guess what? Still not implemented, and it is almost mid-2016. The sad part is, by the time FreeJam actually decides to implement clans, all of the top clans in the game will be dead, as all of their veteran members will find better things to do with their time than to play this. 4) Minimal skill required. If you were looking for a game where putting in tons of hours would give you a significant skill advantage over new players, please look elsewhere. FreeJam has stated that they want the game to be more accessible to new players. This might be good for new players, but for anyone who has invested a significant amount of time into the game, it is just a slap in the face.FreeJam: One step forward, two steps back. Always.""",0
21596,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewEver wondered what moving to another country and then finally returning back to your former country only to find it a burning cesspit feels like? because I sure do.This game is a mere shell of it's former self, it used to be great, it was simple, it was fun. Then the devs decided to destroy the aspect of creativity, make billions of new types of weapons that nobody asked for, (and are completely overpowered) and make it a complete pay to win cash grab. Guess how that went. 99% of the positive reviews are from when the game was actually enjoyable. Also, if you're thinking ""well at least they didn't screw up the ranking system"" They did that too. They removed megabots which completely destroyed the idea of working towards the goal of creating a huge robot.""Could this get any worse?"" a veteran robocraft player would say, and unfortunatley, it does. instead of having a tech tree where you gradually earn new parts as you level up you now have a crate system where you have to spend REAL money to get a random part.If Robocraft would go back to what it was before, I would play it again.

Any building is also now limited to one robot as you cannot use one part in multiple builds, I scrapped all my robots from pre-update to buy half of weapons for my main one. It is Hearthstone where you can only use your legendary card in only one deck.However grind is not biggest problem of this game.

21602,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewNow this game used to be a lot of fun! It had a solid economy and pretty much worked as advertized, you build a vehicle and then you battle it out in different match types, you would get rewarded, even more with premium, and with the rewarded currency, you could buy new parts for your vehicle... I am writing ""it used to"" because the developer decided to promote their premium stronger and thus changed the economy model to a random drop system. This at the begining might be fun but soon you notice that you can't just buy the stuff you need to build your robot. You would have to recycle your previous rewards in order to get a fraction of their wealth back as robits, with which you could buy your desired items then... This means, the game has developed away from it's initial freedom and appeal of a building game, to just farm a bit and then buy and build what ever you wish, into a total gamble. You are now totally dependent on luck with your drops and every time you get a loot crate, you are offered additional random drops as premium player. This basically goes entirely against the initial freedom the game was advertized for. There are more issues right now, unbalanced weaponsystem and even very old glitches they never really got to fixing them but the general trend regarding this game strongly points towards becoming a moneygrab.There are lots of problems, which were solved absolutely nicely before the ""epic loot"" update for example, since everyone wants the protonium crate now, people are playing also against their own team for the top spot on the leaderboard, resulting in teams not playing together anymore.Also seal clubbing has become really common, bringing high endgame weapons into lower lever matches, to become the topscorer and thus also getting rewarded with the protonium crate... That is right, there is no difference right now, wether you win a match on your level or low level, does not matter, you get the same totally random generated protonium crate, which has the highest chance to give you some legendary items in theory but these chances are still so slim, it is almost always random crap, as well as in the other boxes. So enjoy the game as long as you do but i can't recommend getting to invested in it's current state.",0
21603,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewGreatly dissapointedEDIT: 27 feb 2017After a week with a new elo-based ranking system, the win-lose ratio is nearly perfectly 50%. This might be considered a good thing, except it's litterally every other game is a win or a lose. And not by after a long, even battle either. Complete walkover every single game. Only thing that changes is if you're the one roflestomping the other team, or the one being roflstumped. Losing a game after a long, hard, even fight is fun. Losing a game after the enemy team has decided 15min is enough time to grind up kills for XP is not. Still greatly dissapointed.",0
21604,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewTL;DR: Another Veteran gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rambles on about the ""good ol' days"" of Robocraft, and won't be returning even IF they decide to roll back to one of their older versions.I have another ~200 or so hours on their launcher, as well as the 410 hours here, and have been playing on and off since it first appeared in Early Access. Meaning, I've played around when it was just wheels, hovers, and flyers. Not real sure if it was planes, choppers, or both, though.Thing is, I can remember a time when I first got my hovers and was excited about buzzing around the battlefield that way. However, if they weren't spaced out, you could find yourself floating upside down with an unprotected underside. This was all before the much needed flipping mechanism they installed, then revamped to four seconds instead of ten, as well as no training rooms or what not. Just simple TDM all day every day.Then the insect legs came out, and boy was everyone happy. So much so, there were many who completely failed, but was still fun. Not to mention the fun little designs people created with them. Spiderbots. Spiderbots everywhere. Sure, there was the odd scorpion thrown into the mix, but I remember more spiders than them.This was about the time I left for a few months, and came back to find MEGABOTS. Oh boy, what a train wreck that was when it started. The Megabots before the epic ♥♥♥♥ up with FJ were more artsy than naught, but you have to understand something. The art bots I very much enjoyed were VERY squishy. The reason why was very simple: Each block had different HP, with silver-blue and black-red/green being the highest, and white/glass being the lowest. Yes, glass cubes were easily bought back then, but would drop your framerate to Nil if blown up. Another way to drop the FPS was to attach your bot with as many flags as humanly possible. The more you have, the less amount of bots you'd see on the battlefield, because everyone with crappy computers were lagging real bad.That was a fun time, and I really do miss those days. What with grinding for TP (talent or technical points, not real sure which) to grab that much needed weapon, block, or what have you. Then grind for RP just so you can buy the much needed blocks to allow you into the next tier. That's right folks, I said TIER, and there were 10 of them, 11 with Megabots.Each tier had its own set of blocks needed for you to stay, or else you'll end up in the next one with crap guns, blocks, and armour. Not to mention the fact that if your pilot seat is exposed, and gets nicked by a small shot, you were dead and could only whine about it. There was no ""wait ten seconds to be instantly healed"", only you, in the middle of nowhere, waiting for death. Sure. There were healers around this time, but they were more focused on the Mega and not your sorry♥♥♥♥♥Then came the ""The Pit"", which was okay, I guess. Never really got into it, and still don't. Would rather work as a team, rather than duke it out with four to nine other bots. However, they had their own set of problems. Such as instantly healing after getting to the top of the board. There was an exploit in there, where a person was able to have a continuous heal added to their bots if they made it just right. I'm not one to say how, but they patched it out within a couple of months.Afterwards came ""Challenge Battle"", but I'm pretty sure its referred to as ""Battle Arena"". Again, it wasn't my thing, even though it gave everyone a chance at better tactics and strategies. Not to mention the increased revenue for completing such a thing, and the introduction to callouts on the minimap. This also came with a bug, more of an exploit really. Where one team with superior firepower would ""farm"" the other team for points whilst waiting at their base. They wouldn't touch the main crystal, and simply went for the people who spawned in. Pretty sure there's a comic about it floating around Reddit with this.Really, though, this was a fun time to play Robocraft, until the majour ♥♥♥♥up everyone knows about. Such as the removal of Tiers (BIG MISTAKE, FJ), removing the way people gained their blocks, modules, armour, etc, and shoving everyone into what they called ""Battle Ranking"". Went away for a month, came back, and found it to be horrid. Then again, I stuck around just to see what else they did.What did they bring? Why, new weapons, armour, and modules of course. not to mention the removal of Megabots. I love Megas, and had two; one SMG and one Plasma. I miss them both, but FJ doesn't want them, and if they say ""No"", there's not a DAMN we can do about it beyond writing these reviews.Folks, the thing is, I'm not going to recommend this game to ANYONE. If you want to try it out, go right on ahead. The game had its ups and downs, but now its just copying CS;GO and other first person shooters with their loot crates. Not to mention the fact that they've stopped talking to us over on Reddit after all this♥♥♥♥♥♥popped into existence. If they decided to roll back to their previous versions of the game, not many of us would look twice. They've ♥♥♥♥ed up real big this time.PS: At the time of this review, I've about three months of Premium left on my account.",0

21610,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewBack in the day of Robo-Craft's beta, it adopted the gameplay of the popular World of Tanks game; two 15-tank teams, no respawns, a capture point at each team's spawn, 10 tiers for tanks, and a xp based leveling system.  For a long while, things got better. They added an origanal new gamemode, mega-bots, wings, and other smaller things. Soon though, it all went downhill. They removed everything that the game was. They alienated their long time players. What they have done to the game will ultimatly become it's downfall.I got the beta years ago and had several hundered hours on the standalone launcher and later 160 more hours through Steam.

The currency, the object naming system(Its now remenicent of Steiger Tractor co. only more confusing) and now(Good or Bad) The announcer(s?) sound almost exactly like TF2.

They destroyed some of the best aspects of their game. For one, players can only get new cubes/items through loot crates, whose contents are randomized. And, for whatever reason, players can attach multiple weapon types to their craft. It no longer feels like the Robocraft everyone loved, mainly because it no longer is.",0

They pose a threat to society. We will throw these people into sound-proof cells and they will have multiple armed guards and scientists watching them.But in all seriousness, as a guy that spent more than $100 on this game with loot crates, please don't.

The seeking rocket launchers are over powered. Whichever team has a seeking rocket launcher on their team pretty much auto wins.

Please get rid of the rocket launchers. Bring back the old robocraft i know and love. I have 106 hours... on the old version.

21620,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI liked Robocraft when I played it about two years ago.Now I can say that I sorta hate it.Everything that was good about the game has been crushed and everything that was bad has gone worse.At the beginning we had a Tier System that differed experienced players from players that need help finding their own♥♥♥♥♥♥when they need to take a♥♥♥♥♥♥This is gone.Now we only have one tier - tier crap.I kinda grinded to the top level guns and the tier 10 cubes because I wanted to play with grown up individuals that now how to play and that took some time. Then the system was changed but i still had fun, sometimes.WIth the latest patch the game absolutely got destroyed. The crate-reward-model is pointless and P2W ... but I can't hardly see anyone pay money for this game because the matchmaking system is even worse than the new P2W model.What do I want from a game?To have fun!How do I have fun in a game?To compete with other individuals that match my skill in a fair enviroment and to play together with people that also match my skill.I want the game to be challenging and I want to be rewarded for my efforts to fight my team to victory.This is gone, it's all gone.The matchmaking system is extremely stupid and destroys the game in it's basic principles.So it's impossible to have a fair match because of people dropping out of teams and not getting replaced. Or the enemies team has like a four person squad that knows how to play and stomps you into the ground. Or the enemies team is just significantly better rolled.From ten matches I lose like seven and now to the worst thing, everytime I lose a rank aswell, that means, I can't get higher than silver ... thats where I start grinding my teeth. I would say, that I built a decent bot that has proven it's concept since the early alpha. I am always one of the three top players of my team. But I kinda always lose a rank because of the poor match making mechanics that suck me in an abyss and I have no chance to overcome that. Not by skill, not by effort.This makes the game not only pointless for me, it becomes a raging hell of frustration.I can not recommend this game to anyone who isn't a jerk or likes to feel eternal frustration.But heeeey the graphics look nice, the building system is very cool, the game types have a lot of potential.But this is worth nothing until the match making system has been fixed.I quit.

21627,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewToday, I'll be reviewing Robocraft, or what is left from it after the amount of updates to make devs more money.So to start this off, Robocraft was a great game -- I played it a long time ago when there were Tiers. The system worked like this: You buy an item, the item has ""robot ranking"", if your robot ranking is high enough, you advance to next ""tier"", where only bots from the same tier are (or from higher if you had a party). The way the money worked was pretty straight forward -- you can buy with real money special points which can get you anything from tech points to the weapons you cant afford, but as much as I can say it was pretty balanced and not pay2win.The system is currently really terrible because of multiple reasons: Pretty much you can share your robot. Don't take this the wrong way -- it's a nice touch that you can try other player's, but this pretty much killed the must for building your own.So much stuff was changed -- tech tree was completelly removed so now everyone can buy anything. This means you can get against yourself 5 lock-on missile launchers that are pretty much undodgable, unless you have an obstacle between you and the robot that shoots them. The thing I loved in old robocraft was the amount of free premium codes -- there were so many premium codes for free to help you climb. I feel like it's rare to have any currently. The most terrible thing however is, that you no longer drop raw money from battles -- depending on your position in ladder you get a box that varies on rarity, obviouslly the better you play the better you get. To get most money devs made it that you get 4-8 items, but half of them are ONLY for premium users -- what has actually happened to me was getting multiple legendaries, why is that bad? They were all in the premium-only section and I didn't have premium.tl:dr - The devs ruined this game from its original version, which was playable without tons of pay2win content.",0

While a lot of community back lash has occured as of late, I still have faith in the developers for the most part.

21630,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewMe (At Launch): I like this game! It's a unique vehicular-based shooter where teamwork and communication are the keys to success! Sadly, this game is filled with 10 year olds, but even without communication its a cool time killer. You get to design your vehicle fairly easy, and its pretty cool that everyone has a different machine, adding a large amount of diversity to the game. To get cubes to build your vehicle, you earn a currency during matches that you can buy cubes with and you unlock more cube with a different currency. There is another currency that costs real money, but it buys the same thing as the F2P currency and a couple cosmetics but that's it. A very fun game.Me (Later): Ok they changed the game a little bit, in ways i don't really like, but it is still an ok game. You still have the F2P currency and the P2P currency but now you don't need to unlock the cubes. It makes it so someone can take a Super-OP gun and put it on their tiny vehicle and it gets grouped up with the weak-vehicles with 20 very-weak guns. It doesn't matter how small the OP vehicle is because it kills anything that it sees instantly. There is also now a ""community"" market, which allows people to post their creations and other people can download them, if they pay for all the cubes that it costs to build it. A cool sharing system, but now people can just download the very-well built vehicles, which means now there is no creativity or diversity in most matches when 5 people have the same OP vehicle. A pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t update if you ask me, but the game is still all right, I guess...Me (Now): ♥♥♥♥ this game, it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. Now there is NO F2P currency. Nothing. Now we have ♥♥♥♥ing crates. OH WOW SO UNIQUE! ♥♥♥♥ING CRATES! You can get all the cubes you could have bought before by playing the game, but now you get VERY VERY VERY MUCH LESS. ""Oh you spent the entire match healing a guy who was defending the base and pretty much saved your team from annhilation? Oh here you can have THE WORST CHEST IN THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME THAT GIVES YOU 20 CORNER BLOCKS."" So now you're ♥♥♥♥ed because when you're trying to build a unique vehicle, have fun building it out of corner blocks.

I only played a few matches (getting 1st or second on the board in each one I might add) but those matches lacked any real desire for tactics in them and were kind of just rush to the enemy base and destroy it (I could only get in one of the types of  matches even, really wanted to play the deathmatch, but it was just not to be. Waited forever and it wouldn't find a match.)Currently I would say this at best is just a quick time waster, if even that. I'm afraid I probably won't play it again. It was just rather boring.Not sure if this will help anyone decide to play it or not. Honestly its free so it doesnt really matter all that much and I'm not really mad about the game. Just disappointed.",0
21635,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is a horrible pay-to-win piece of garbage. Im putting a negative review from all 4 of my accounts and told all my friends, some of which dont even play it, to put a negative review. And its staying negative until the game becomes playable. This garbage made by a group of inbred degenerates could be so much better. It could compete with other big fanbase games like LoL, CSGO, Warframe, DOTA 2, etc if they changed it just a little bit. The amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t theh spew with ""we updated the game and made it better"" is just sad. Please fix it.Also, add some d@mn achievements and trading cards. So players get an extra reward besides some random shyt ingame. A lot of players love badges and cards. And maybe some tradable items that players can trade with each other through Steam like skins or weapons.I would also like to mention the fact that about 6 months ago i played and had bought some weapons and had also spent money on this trash to get some stuff. I recently turned on the game to see that the game has been changed and all my stuff was gone and instead of them i had 3 starter robots that i dont want.",0
21636,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access Reviewtl:dr Game was ruined by money hungry devs who don't listen to thier fan baseOk, man this is hard to write. Let's start from the beginning:Imagine little baby me when I was 10, finding a game where you could build robots and pit them against eachother in a arena. My 10 year old mind couldn't handle it! I was freaking out! It was the best thing I had ever found. I played this game for a couple of years, day and night, thinking about what crazy design I could make when I got home from school. i then went on a holiday with my family. I came back, and tiers had been removed. That feeling of anticipation when you neared the next tier, was gone. I was pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ So, I took a break from the game for a couple of months, and when I came back? Armour cubes were gone. No compensation for the hours and hours that I spent farming those ♥♥♥♥ers, no warning. I soldiered on though, and kept playing. Then, the crates, ooooooh the crates, that was the last straw, Robocraft was no longer the game I fell in love with. I write this review with a heavy heart, and little faith in what is to come.- Goodbye Robocraft-",0
21637,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFreejam has continiously shown that they have no vision for this game and don't know what they're doing.  They're blatantly ignoring the majority of player feedback and stubbornly continue to stick to updates no one enjoys or wanted in the first place.   They remove large pieces of content on a whim ( Megabots+2 gamemodes ) and the F2P model has gotten greedier and greedier as time went on.  Furthermore they've changed their payment model, but if you purchased items with real money that are now available with in game currency, you where never refunded for them, wow!  Crate rewards are far too low and we need to be rewarded more, especially in deathmatch, and the losing team is always screwed over with a crap crate even if they individually performed very well.Freejam seems to believe that it should take hundreds of hours to get to any sort of endgame, so if you're fairly casual, this game simply isn't for you.",0
21638,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewI give this a thumbs down not because of the new update but the matchmaking system newbs (like me ) have a hard time playing because players that is like level 20+ and have like rocket launchers lower their cpu therefore matched with other players with lower cpu they do this because they cant win on higher cpued matches and to get more loot its really annoying for us newbs because we cant get points (i cant even aim) .If im wrong and the matchmaking sytem matches people with their levels please correct me.Potato,0
21639,Robocraft,2017.0,Early Access ReviewIt was fun for th first couple of hours. But after a certain point i was matched with nothing but players robots that outclassed my entire team by a landside. To the extent that single player could kill the entire team by themselve. They need to fix the matching system. Until thats fixed theres no point in playing.,0
21640,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access Review**** epic loot its such bsso now i have to pay to have a slight chance at rare items?the game was great before areoflak now its a steaming pile of horse****Hope they fix it though i dont have much hope,0
21641,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewI expected this game to get better over the years but all the devs are doing is trying to make it more profitable with microtransactions. Now I just feel that I wasted all that time by expecting it to get better. This game is now far past its prime and it will keep going downhill; the developers are trying to force people to spend money when all they need to do is make a good game.,0
21642,Robocraft,,"really want Free Jam to read this and new players to understand that I am speaking from a veteran's POV. This isn't meant to be a harsh. I want to make this review as detailed as possible (except the 3rd paragraph) for people who read this and for free jam. I can't ""recommend"" this game YET but I do encourage people to try it. Robocraft has to overcome some hurdles before I can safely recommend it (I REALLY ENJOY THE GAME, I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT... I also want to emphasize that with each update, I have adapted to changes and ended up enjoying them later on). I want to give an overview of how I feel about robocraft and I will try to give an effective outline of what I want to say. This isn't me defending or bashing the game. This review is meant to be fair.I want to talk about the current movement system of robocraft and how I feel about it. I want to talk about the current weapons in-game and how the current balancing is. I want to briefly mention the Factory. I want to briefly mention my feelings about the current maps (in general, not specifically). I want to talk about some issues I have with the current matchmaking (this won't be your typical ""It Sucks or ""I love crushing noobs"" or ""I get crushed by every meta/ pro user"") and offer a solution. I want to talk about the use of bots in matchmaking. I want to talk about my problems with current custom game options and offer solutions. I want to talk about Robocraft's community (There is might be some SALT in here. Be Warned). Finally, I will finalize with the largest problem I see that is really hard to deal with and propose solutions (If this is resolved, then I think it will help the game as a whole).The Current Movement system is VERY player friendly. You can even have more than one type of movement on your bot. Anyone can make a plane with enough wings and propellers. I am not even joking. I made a Ugandan Knuckles Fly.  You can make tanks as well via tank treads. Mechs are also a good choice for players who are used to first/ 3rd person point of view games. Camera controls are set as default to help people out. Keyboard controls are good for some planes and all tanks. Wheels are good for making meme vehicles and good for starter bots (not the ones free jam has for the new player). I don't advise them in tier 5. Heli-Copter blades are cool since you can strafe and have a ton of mobility options with them. Hover blades are very easy to use and if used in a broken fashion, very Overpowered. Currently, if you place a hover blade under your hover craft, you float higher. My solution is that Hovercrafts floating height should be based on center of mass instead of the lowest hover blade. Also, give the different tiered hover blades different max floating heights based off of tier. Insect legs are very bad. They don't do as their were originally intended to do. When I use them, even when I don't violate their carry limit, they slowly fall down the wall. They don't cling to ceilings. As a solution, I made 2 insect bots that do these things but I had to use thrusters (alot of them) in order to get them to do this (If interested, look up ""Block Widdow"" or ""The Hanger"" in the factory, use keyboard controls). The hanger demonstrates perfectly what I want in wall clinging but can't turn on ceilings very well. The Block Widdow demonstrates what I want in terms of clinging to a ceiling and can turn just fine, but it doesn't have enough thrusters to keep it pinned to a wall perfectly like The Hanger is able to do. If insect legs get reworked, the camera will need to be reworked to allow people to see better when they are on ceilings. The current weapon balance in tier 5 is... Terrifying. The Mega Plasma (with the help of the trusty Power Module) CAN completely destroy robots with a well place, accurate attack on a ground vehicle. The Rail Impaler has turned away from being a heavy sniper into a ""rapid"" fire precision based weapon. The Mega SMG gun, well, its fine. The Flak Cannon is seriously weak. The LOML deals an absurd amount of damage and is now replacing the flak cannon as anti air. The Mortar got nerfed hard, which I don't know how I feel about that since I started maining it until it got nerfed. The Shotgun (Ion Distorter) feels useless. Until weapons are balanced in way that is SATISFYING to FREE JAM (and the perhaps the community), robocraft should not receive anymore weapons. I feel like everytime a weapon was introduced, everything was nerfed to accommodate it instead of the other way around. I am unsure on any solutions on how to balance these different weapons other than testing them on different types of bots that are block spam (I consider block spam as the control group in this position). P. S. T0 smgs need an increased fire rate.The factory was a huge risk that paid off until meta started to take over. The factory made a war between fighters and builders. The Fighters obviously win. I see far less builders than I do fighters in tier 5. The same goes to T1. I don't think there should be T1/T2 bots on the factory so that new players can get the experience of using and fighting against genuine, creative, original robots. I have no solution for this because this to me has irreversible damage.In regards to all the maps for normal gameplay, I feel like they are too small. The old maps from the beginning, were really cool but I think Free Jam made them smaller to accommodate the smaller player base. I think there needs ro be more maps. More Maps with some new gimmicks, like parts of the map move as time progresses or if lever/ buttons are pressed. Or places for smaller bots where bigger bots can't travel. Or a an enclosed, cave like maps that include darkness, to make use of neon cubes and headlights and a reworked version of insect legs.In Regards to matchmaking, casual players and competitive players shouldn't mix but I think they were meshed together to adapt to the low amount of players this game currently has. When this game gets its player base up again, Have a League mode where all teirs are meshed together. Keep the current tier system the same. In regards to custom games, I think there should be a public/ private settings on it. I mean like allow people to random join. People will host games and people can search for your custom game in a some sort of menu. The Matchmaking system in forged alliance is a good example. For when the movement system is adjusted to f=ma, add an option in custom games to enable speed boost.The Community needs to stop preaching that this game is dieing. This will turn off new players to this game. I don't care if its a fact, everyone knows that this game has had a declining player base since loot crates were introduced. When Free jam introduces good content, the player base spikes (looking at steam charts) Robocraft already has damaged reputation and that in itself is hard to overcome. Free Jam needs the player base needs to offer solutions instead of ""The game is dead"". Other than that, the community is cool. Lots of people are willing to help out. Also, New players shouldn't be able to get access to T5 parts so easily.Now to get to the root problem that plagues Free Jam. The main center of conflict that Free Jam is wrestling with is the current lack of players. Solutions? Well I think if Free Jam can introduce new content (other than weapons), great fixes and focus on fixing problems first, at a high enough quality, at a high enough rate, then this game will flourish. For content ideas, I would like to see a grapple hook of some sort that you could swing with. I would like to see with this grapple hook that it could be used to carry team mates (like a heli carrying a tank) or pull you towards enemies. Thank you for your time. I encourage Free Jam to do well and the current community to help them in their journey. Again I can't recommend this game yet but I encourage people to try this game and share their views on it AND to share ideas.",1
21643,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access Reviewthe game used to be really fun. now its just kinda broken. Loot systems promote high level players grinding low level players for stuff, so if you're new to the game, expect a bad time",0
21644,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewTerrible update for new players. You won't get anything done: single tires? I guess playing 100 matches to get a match of 4 tires is an awesome way to keep players playing. That's japanese MMORPG masochistic level of grinding. I bet it's more fun to hold a pebble in the rain and waiting for it to turn into a grain of sand. Matchmaking is also broken for smaller bots, you'll have to fight bots with weapons that have more health than your whole bot. Before the update: 8/10, afterwards 1/10.If you already have good bot, it's still fun to abuse the system and  pwn smaller players in the ground. Exept it isn't",0
21645,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI have been with robocraft for quite a while, and honestly, I do not like the direction they are going. It used to be a great build and bash that was pretty balanced, but it seems like over the updates, the balance has gone away. Pay to win is the name of this game with the recent update, no more money from winning matches, just random ""loot"" crates, that you only get half of if you are not a premium user.While they do drop free premium every once in a while, it's not keeping me attached to this game anymore.

21648,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game used to be about engineering and it was very fun.The engineering depth was removed to the point of Robocraft becoming a generic fps with sluggish controls.The developers seem to be trying to mix features from multiple games into their game, and it's not working. The random crate drop system is bad, the chief game mode (battle arena) is boring, and the skill depth of both building and fighting has been reduced to the competence of a 8 year old. The awful thing is that this game used to be a lot more fun before many changes were made.In short, stay away from Robocraft.

21653,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access Reviewthe game was a little unbalanced when i started, some wepons were a little over powered such as the proto seeker, rail guns,tesla,... and some wepons (including building blockes) were under powered such as the plasma canons,sheilds,lasers, basic cubes...but the consept was great. you had robot levels and every time you leveled (i cant spell) up you got 10 CPU (which allowes you to add extra matereals to your robot) and you unlocked an item or a set of items. the consept of RP (robopoints) was confusing, but the way you earned them and how much you earned was well thought out. every time you leveled up you usualy had enough RP to buy the new items. selling unwanted items was well thoughout and fairly priced. and the dynamics movment of the techs you built was well created and handled by the game. when the big update on april 28 came out RP was replaced with robo bits and all wepons and building blocks were rebalanced perfectly. HOWEVER (THIS IS A BIG HOWEVER), loot crates are a problem as they make robocraft look like other games like war thunder or pixle gun with a reward after fighting and a dayly reward, but the main sad thing is that when you level up, you dont unlock anything new (besides CPU), you can purchase everything right off the bat which removes the fealing of accomplishment. if it becomes anything more like other games i will UNINSTALL ROBOCRAFT... at that point its a waste of hard disk space to me.   i am so sorry but im worried about the future of this game",0

There were some additions that were cool and fun like Arena Battles, the Maximum Loadout update(for the most part), the community robot factory, and so on.. However, they slowly removed some of our favorite features like low tier vs high tier battles,  Megabot battles and megabots in general,  and other things that aren't coming to mind(there were quite a few.)

Almost everytime you get something half decent, its in the premium only section.  Everything in the store is super expensive, and sells for practically nothing.  Its kind of disgusting how they changed all their systems so that its more profitable.  I loved this game, and I want to play it, but everytime I do it shows me just why I stopped.  Its about that time that I reinstall it, check out the new stuff, hate the game again, and stop playing for another 1/2-3/4 of a year.  I dont know why I keep coming back. I know they're not going to fix what they've done, but I just keep hoping, and keep being disapointed.  Theres a reason that most people who played from the beggining dont play anymore.

The new players can now get everything and boast. I would like them to make the chest better fro the people above lvl 70 or something but much weaker for the newer players and it gets better.,0

Back when there was classes to play and MEDIC's, back before you just heal because you hide for 10sec, back to when triforcing armour ment something, BACK TO WHEN IT WAS FUN!",0

You lose? well the random thing can give you a better stuff than the win reward.

21669,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewBuild a robot, fight others creations, survive in a deathmatch, pit yourself against others in an arena, or play against the joke of an AI...  I've noticed a severe decrease in 'art' and 'creative' designs, which was something I rather enjoyed back in the day. I remember anime characters battled with galleons battled with angels battled with some of the most beautiful bots i've seen in any game. Now the gullotine has fallen, the blade has cut the creativity from the flesh of a game that used to be pretty epic. Might as well go play Mechwarrior. That's what this has become.What used to be a game that had a uniqueness and epic system for earning and battling has become something of a common scene. Freejam has made another bad decision, taking from the game the ability to earn the game credits (also known as RP) and given to it 'loot boxes' that pretty much drop... well, junk, things that can't be used or aren't worth enough to even catch the eye of a down on his luck Ferengi.I've played this game for several years, enjoyed the Megas, loved the artforms and creativity that had become prominant amongst the more imaginitive.

21670,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewMy first review about this game was positive because I was mainly playing the Single Player mode. After a few hours, that was not enough anymore then I started to play Team Deathmatch and Battle Arena. At TD there's no reason to play serious. Even if you get top score, if you die you'll receive the same Bronze box you would receive if you died at the start of match (after do some damage to an enemy, only). There's no teamwork because only the top score ALIVE at the end of the match will receive the Protonium box, so is just a race for kills and points. If by any chance you finish the match alive, but you did no damage to an enemy, you'll not receive any box: 0 score = 0 box, even on the winning team.BA has (usually) better players and teamwork because you need to capture points and defend base, but you still will find rushers that just run to the enemy base to destroy it fast,  My main complain about this game is:There's no reason to work a long time in garage to design and build a robot only to be made in pieces by a micro robot using shotgun with hovers and 5 cubes as base, just because the matchmaker allow this kind of stupid design.

21674,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI got this game as a gift several months ago. When I got the game, I encountered a game of creativity and of combat, which I liked. The game's ranking system made sure you were matched with comparable bots with comparable armaments, which resulted in fairly intense matches with two nearly equally matched teams. However, as of the latest big update, the game suffers from a horrible game balance issue. Weapons are now handed out at random, and 'rare' weapons are able to unilaterally dominate battles. The new crate system intends to reward good gameplay, but the tiering of crates is largely cosmetic, with the highest teir gear being practically the same rarity in low tier crates as in high tier crates. Their rarity is hardly a justificaton for the weapons' power, especially since for a few bucks, people can buy the highest tier crates. Robocraft discourages new players by pitting them against the power weapons with little to defend themselves. Robocraft discourages the creative process by making roughly three styles of vehicles the only survivable ones, and by making the power weapons so costly to add to a bot (in terms of pFlops, the game's unit of bot complexity) that if a bot is to be effective, it must be extremely basic with a power weapon on it. Robocraft discourages veterans of the game by making the level system and robot rank system nearly obsolete, turning the game's tech tree into a game of chance. The power weapons were originally only available by purchase, so the update did do good by taking previous 'pay to win' weapons and making them at least remotely accessible for free. But Robocraft is no longer a game of skill and creativity. Its balancing points have become a wheel of fortune, a wheel that can be greased by money (that runs a risk of being wasted since rarities still exist in the purchasable crates).In short, the game used to be fun. Once again in gaming history, crates corrupted the game.",0

21680,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAs of late this game has become cancerous, horrible, terrible, absolutely crap. Ill be talking about some major points.1: Weapons2: Types of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bots3: Rewards after each match4: The matching system5: Removed tech tree6: Pilot Seat Removed1: WeaponsThere are 3 major weapons I want to talk about. A: The worst one of them all, the Rocket Launcher B: Anti-air C: Shotguns.A: Rocket launchers are the worst, they are also the most expensive. To use them you lock onto a target and fire away, one volley should more or less kill anything, if not kill it, incapacitate it or heavily damage it unless target does evasive movements, which is just spamming all your movement buttons trying to get to cover. One rocket does 40700 damage, and you fire roughly 12 per volley. It can be placed on anything, tanks, mechs, crawlers and even helicopters, worst thing about them being on helis is that you cant get to cover because they just fly above you and they are hard to hit unless you have anti-air. Basically, these guns require no skill what so ever to use, they seem like a lot but in hind sight, they are very very easy to get, a few days of playing, maybe a week of saving up and you can get one.B: Anti-Air guns, Flak cannons. THey are absolute cancer when it comes to ANYTHING that flies or hovers. They detonate when they come close to a flying thing, you don't even have to be flying, just in the air, so this counts for Mechs who jump or Crawlers who jump too. They cost the LEAST and have the same explosive radius as the strongest Plasma Cannons, which is horse crap. They do 31710 damage each shot but cripple any fliers there are. Some people have both this and a rocket launcher on their ship making it the worst thing in existance to planes and helis.C: Shotguns. THese things arent too bad, they do jack all if you are any further than about 50 yards. They can only be shot 4 times before all your energy is drained and you gotta wait but normally if you get close enough, thats enough to kill anything. THey do the most damage with a shocking 225000 per hit, but that drops durastically as the range increases. They are strong too, with 110618 health, they can take quite a beating.2: Bots. There are several kinds of bots that are just horrible to fight against. A: Mechs B: Box Fliers C: Helis with rockets A: Mechs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. THey have the most health they already come with shields on their legs, they can jump and are relitively fast. The most common mech is one with shotguns or any other god/cancer gun supported by normally the strongest smgs or plasma cannons in the game. These bots are able to take on any other bot and win pretty much, they jump aroudn and get close to you before using their shotgun to wipe the floor with you, or they use their other cancer guns on you. You can kill them if you have a buddy or if you can manage to take out the mechs guns or legs. You can have LITTERALLY everything at the front in one place, gravity doesnt exist for them, it can be as high as the effiel ♥♥♥♥ing tower and have two piddly little legs and it wouldnt matter, it would walk fine, jump fine, fight fine. If you put Pilots Seats back, it would make Mechs a lot harder to build and use.B: Box fliers. These things are the absolute worst. They dont have wings or heli blades, just thrusters, the way that they are built means its hard to actually kill them or deal sufficiant damage in big doses unless you are right up close to them or you have a shotgun. They do require a sliver of skill to fly and handle but even then it doesnt matter, spend a couple match and you will be flying it well.C: Helis with Rockets. These things are the absolute worst, unless you ahve a rocket or anti-air on your team, you are screwed, this thing is able to fly just to the end of your render distance and fire rockets at you, its hard to get cover as they can just fly over it, normally supported by Plasma Cannons or sometimes SMGs, these things are horrible to deal with.3: Rewards. Ok so, the rewards are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, its chance. You could do the best in the team but get the worst rewards due to luck, you get items now which is annoying kind of, anyone can get anything, a new player could get a shotgun or a rocket lancher. But if you get it, yaaay. You dont get enough money from rewards though, normally. I prefered it when it was money you got from rewards, made it so much better.4: Matching system. They have always had issues with this, if you have a bot with 1000 Pflops, you get put in a game with people that have 1000 Pflops, but some people have no soul and are probably bullies irl or have some sort of issue as they go into those matchs with small ships with rediculously op guns and armour.5: Tech tree was removed, bad move, now anyone can buy the really strong guns if they save up enough. A new player could buy the second strongest Plasma Cannon with ease, same with the SMG. Then refere to the Matching System above6: Pilot Seat Removed: Naah mate, thats silly, having the pilot seat was good because it made people armour up around the seat the most, it made people actually think about how best to make the craft to protect the pilot AND give it the best fire power possible AND it gave people the ability to think about where to shoot the bot, where you thinking the seat is to kill them most efficiently, the only bad thing was you could get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t one shot.Some people are complaining about the fact that you can have 5 different types of guns on your ship, i agree in some ways but at the same time i think it was needed, sometimes a guy with only plasma cannons cant defend himself against a flier. If a Plasma Cannon user came up against an SMG user, he'd pretty much lose in most scenarios because he'd have his guns shot off, the SMGs could get shot off too but you normally run out of energy before you can do that, but if you have at least some smgs you can put up a slightly better fight. I think maybe reduce it to 3 and have cancer/god guns take up all three of thoseSummary: Anything that flies is NEXT TO ♥♥♥♥ING USELESS! Rockets need to be removed or nerfed a bunch, Flak need to cost more and have a reduced explosion size, shotguns, meh, their fine, Box fliers need to be stopped somehow as they are over powered. Mechs need a nerf too. If you use a cancer/god gun you should be put into matchs with other people who have the same god guns. The Matching system needs to be fixed and the reward system needs to be fixed aswell.",0

21683,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeThis game crashes. A LOT.Why, I have to admit, this new ""Epic Loot"" update is great... For the first hour or two if it's your first time playing and the blocks you have are the crumby ones you get the very first time you play the game. Though once you get over how ""amazing"" that singular rare gun you got from that one lucky crate is, you'll succumb to the fact that basically everything you find in a crate is rubbish, especially since you have to buy premium to get half of what's in the crates anyways. This crate system can be seen one of two ways; either pay-to-win, or getting on your knees and praying to the RNG gods that, once, just once, you'd get an epic item from your protonium crate. Also here's a little anecdote that shows how terribly far both of these things have gone; I found a stinkin' legendary item in a bronze crate, but I needed premium to have collected it (The same thing happened to my friend, but with a different item). Speaking of big guns, they are litterally all you need to excel at this game. I build a 750 pflop tank, and it loses to some tiny bot, 90% of which is a single gun. Seriously? I could have sworn that spending time building a bot and succeeding with said bot had some relationship. I guess not. But who am I trash talk micro-bots. I built one myself, and I can get 6 kills in a single deathmatch with it (most of the time building goes into where I should put more hoverblades). Finally, this game crashes. A lot. Though most of the time, it seems to happen when I finally find a team of decent allies in an arena battle and things are going well. What a coincedence.....2016-12-16 Edit: It's been a while and there have been many big changes to Robocraft so I feel that my review could use an update too. First off; my thoughts on the ""Fast and Formidable"" update. As a player with moderate experience and a fair few decent parts, I enjoyed having the ability to build a 2000 pflop (maximum value) robot. Although quite a few Robocraft veterans would disagree, I think this update was a small step in the right direction. I could build as I please, but still feel confident with a slightly smaller bot. But this brawl update. This brawl update is no fun. Freejam has decided to (instead of listening to the community) remove multiple game modes, and throw them into a cycle with a few new modes and call it the ""Brawl"" mode. This would have been fine if they did it like Overwatch and just added a brawl as a new game mode, but no. Though at this point, I'd be a fool to be surprised when Freejam disappoints the community.",0
21684,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewFirst, let me take you back when this game was good. I was looking for a game that was, of course, multiplayer and really wasn't a big pay to win game like most of the free to play games on steam are. (Free to play does come with a cost). The game was easy to learn and allowed great creativity in designs of bots and strats. They added new blocks every update or so, that even furthered the game play by allowing users to unlock them in the tech tree and play enough games to save up and buy it. I've kept a watch on the updates and finally re-downloaded the game to see some of the recent changes, as its been awhile since i played. I was very intrigued by the new game modes and ability to put multiple weapon types on your bot at a time. Which I personally thought was a step up and further gameplay mechanics. However, upon entering a game I was quickly destroyed by a guy camping with these lock on missile launchers. At first, I was amazed at the power of these weapons but, after a few minutes of repeatedly getting spawn killed by the same guy started to take a toll on me. I looked at the block store and the price for one is outrageous. Owning one means you don't have a life, or you do and you wasted your hard earned earnings on an item that is OP. Now, of course, the whole loot crate thing which is a totally different story by itself. What happened to you play a game and you get money? Now you get random drops from a loot crate. The drops depending on how bad your team sucked. With this, i can see how this might be good for low-level people who take what ever they can get to improve their bot. In the late game, I totally waste my time and money by selling these 5 or so random drops to save up for an item I do want. Like those lock on rockets for example. Premium is trash. Currently have a 3-day premium from confirming my email, so first-hand experience! With premium, you get an extra 5 or so items that I think have a slighter chance of receiving a rare item. Which then I sell anyways.  The GUI for building your robot I think has improved greatly. I am now allowed to mirror blocks that make building speedier. Then there are premium paint colors! Seriously guys? I cant paint a block a certain color without premium? What a joke. Currently still trying to find the tech tree and will hopefully report back when I find it! My current ship was a medic flyer which I flew around the map healing, everyone. I joined my first arena match with it and like I said earlier, I was getting spawn killed by that little *****. I then realized after the fact that the nano disrupters now don't do damage to enemy players? What? They pretty much nerfed everything except those rare items and up. If you like to waste your money on this game and buy your way up the ladder than look no further because this is the game for you! Just enter your card number and instantly win every match you play! After a week or so of nonstop fun, you will then realize that it gets old and you wasted 20 or so dollars on a game you don't want to play anymore. For a game that started out with a lot of potential, I'm sad to say that this game has turned to a pay to win hell hole. I did enjoy this and have had good moments with this, and I do recommend this to new players who need a game that can be easily run on low-end computers. However if you have a higher end computer World of Tanks or Minecraft if you want to keep the creativity aspect. I will still keep on looking for the updates for improvement that might improve this game. Yes, I still do have hope, just very little. Meanwhile im moving to the dying cod franchise where I can experience the satisfaction of eliminating a team of little kids by myself. without having to pay to win.BTW- I did not waste any money on this game and I am proud to say everything I earned was earned legitly through game play. so I cant really fully say its a pay to win but it sure does come in handy!",0
21685,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewUsed to play this game a lot because it was fun. It was fun grinding games to get myself a set of the best armor and watch as all of my bots slowly turn black, the color of the highest tier armor back then. They removed the tiers and all my grinding went to waste; I am okay with that because the armor was cheap and I could buy literally millions of them after every match because I was using a megabot; they then removed megabots, I was sad but the game was still fun to play. There were things to build and things to look forward to. My efforts in game was reflected in my rewards after every match. Now the rewards are no longer really based on skill, its all RNG now, you could do the best in the entire match and get worse rewards than the player on the bottom of the scoreboard. You don't get money anymore so you have to rely on RNG to get the item you want instead of just saving up. TL;DR:Rewards in game are based on RNG instead of an earn-money-buy-item, The rates are worse than a japanese waifu phone game. Your efforts in game no longer match your reward.",0

21689,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewHonestly This game Is a great concept and visually it works. There is alot to be said that is good about such a game, the voxel based construction and all its great its wonderful, but that is where it stops.The developers have repeatedly and continuously turn the game on its head since I started playing (before it was on steam) yes some changes arguably are and were merited but in general they have made many poor decisions and continue to keep making poor decisions. The game has been out well over a year and they claim they are still ""One step Closer to Beta"" as they launch their latest patch of poor decisions. These recent patches like most of the others have affected balance, destroyed the matchmaking system, and uterly decimated the economy. Expect to play 200-400 matches to build a fully functional robot with matching parts. Free-Jam does not admit to their mistakes, fix problems ,or even really listen to the community that despite disagreeing still want to see the game to succeed and come to fruitionIf you have been playing this game for awhile yeah you can still occasionally have fun as you already have the parts and the game-play and building still retains most of its appeal. But if you are new to the game I suggest looking elsewhere, you  are in for lots of seal clubbing by more experienced/better armed players, and rewards from battle that will keep you the unfortunate prey for many many many games to come.Maybe some day the Devs will mature and the game will stabilize, but until then I cannot recommend this game.",0

Here is a TL;DR version: it is OK to frustrating real quick Pay-To-Have-Fun Controls oddly and bugs when you don’t want it to Needs to be flushed out more Needs a catch-up mechanic The loot crate system is total BS Play with friends for 3 days with free premium, then uninstall the game Honestly, only open this game if you can play non-stop with 2-3 friends nonstop for the free premium length. This game makes you laugh, feel epic, and you can really bond with friends with this game. But it gets shallow quick.Here are the problems:“Premium”As you guess, you need to pay for this. It is a bit, but you get a free 3 day trial when you offer up your email. Nothing too bad on the surface, but you can see how it can get bad on the surface.I climbed levels way faster than my friend who couldn’t get premium to work, you get more loot (More on this later), and the game just became easier. You would have noticed free earlier. It is paid and not always that good. Prices can get a bit expensive. Since you have to build your vehicle there are 2 limited factors: Your level cap and your parts. You get twice as much paying and you level more so you can use all your shinny things quickly. It handicaps the people that are free. It is not Pay-To-Win but more of a Pay-To-Have-Fun.GameplayHonestly, kinda loose at times but it is ok. As someone use to PC shooters, the A and D rotating instead of moving is weird. It can get into a lot of stumbling which is nothing something you want when someone sneaks up with a giant shotgun and is about to fire. Shooting though drove me nuts. I really liked being a spider with 2 large rail guns and harass the flying people. But when you are point at a plane coming at you, it is shooting lasers, and you line up a shot, click, and NOTHING! It gets infuriating. I zoom out to see that my rail gun as accidently shot the ground, or my armor, or they might have been shot off already, or the worse thing ever is no reason. Now in the game they only let you get together with 3 friends if you are free, or 4 if you are premium. I thought it was strange until I realized why. A good fun bit of the game is fighting in hectic chaos. But when 3 friends get together, they can just march to your base and wreck you. (This is why I suggest playing with friends)When your base is getting assaulted, you need to head back to make sure you don’t lose. Then more enemies come and harass, then more, then more, and you die and have to wait for sometimes over a minute to spawn, defend, die, wait to respawn, and then watch your base explode. You feel hopeless.I feel 2 mechanics are at work. 1) There is no catch up system so if you start losing; chances are you are going to lose.2) It feels like they take a page from heart stone and try to make your wins to losses 50/50This leads to your team face stomping when you do really nothing and you working your♥♥♥♥♥off to see everything fall apart no matter how good you play.Ow, and there is no reporting players so you get some cleaver cheaters.LOOT SYSTEMSo my friend played this a while ago (Marco, if you are reading this, Hi) he told me of an age with cockpits, in-game currency, and planes not sucking at controls. He didn’t like the new loot system at all and I didn’t see why at first. Now I do.Doesn’t matter if you are a free to play or paying, you get displayed with “Loot you get” and “Loot you would have gotten if you have paid!” after a game. There are different tiers of loot crates and other reviews go into more detail but it sucks.It is random. Someone can get a rare item in a silver crate while you get stuck with blocks and uncommon garbage in you diamond box. You can grind up items you don’t want into dust and “Forge” new things you do want from the shop. This is highway robbery at the exchanges they have. When your team wins, your score is doubled so you get better lot. So often times the worse player on the wining team will get more and better stuff then the best player who happens to lose. This can make a game where you got 11 kills, 2 deaths, and many assists to a bronze crate, AND THAT IS LUCKY! It is just still.If you made it this far, good for you! I would give you all the stuff I got, but no in game trading. (Which is a smart move really but you can figure that out) ",0

Please make it the way it was before, I don\'t want to see this game crash and burn. There are so many pros to this game, but that one MASSIVE con is outweighing them all.

I wish they had a classic mode for the older content and robots bought through the store.

21696,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewHistory of robocraft:The Good Old Days:A long long time ago, when this game was fun to play, you used to get robo points to buy parts and tech points to research new parts - this was awesome, a sense of progression. Weapons were well balanced in their associated environments (e.g. SMG's did wonders at close range, with plasmas being effective barrage weapons and rails sniping off crucial parts etc.)The era of Megabots was ushered in, providing tantalising new content for veteren players and something to really look forward to for newer ones. The game was still fun, didnt feel like a grind and premium simply gave faster levels for more CPU and more robo and tech points - it was essentially pay to grind less.Now:I'd like to start off with a good point, then name the bad points in the middle and finish with some good points to represent what this game is now: A Turd Sandwich.+ Beautiful game that inspires creativity- Hackers are now present- If you dont have Premium, you will die of old age before you can afford one of the shamefully OP legendary weapons- Lost all sense of Progression- People spamming the chat begging people to buy their robots from factory+ Air Doge is funny░░░░░░░░░░░█▀▀░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░▄▀▀▀▀░░░░░█▄▄░░░░░░░░░░█░█░░░░░░░░░░▐░░░ ░░░░░░▐▐░░░░░░░░░▄░▐░░░░░░░░░█░░░░░░░░▄▀▀░▐░░░ ░░░░▄▀░░░░░░░░▐░▄▄▀░░░░ ░░▄▀░░░▐░░░░░█▄▀░▐░░░░░ ░░█░░░▐░░░░░░░░▄░█░░░░░ ░░░█▄░░▀▄░░░░▄▀▐░█░░░░░ ░░░█▐▀▀▀░▀▀▀▀░░▐░█░░░░░ ░░▐█▐▄░░▀░░░░░░▐░█▄▄░░░ ░░░▀▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░-- Freejam --░░░░░░░░░",0

21705,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewIf we were back in time around 2014-2015, I would recommend this game. Now, it deserves to be un-recommended. As you might have noticed from other reviews, in the few months after Robocraft was released they had overwhelmingly positive reviews and had lots of potential to be a very popular and unique game. I only started playing around mid-2014 and personally, I thoroughly enjoyed the game back then because of its convenience, fun, and the developer's effort into making a great game. I got the majority of my 116 hours of playtime in the first year since I got it. Now, the game has just gone downhill. Freejam's big updates to add powerful weapons like missile launchers, the removal of stronger armoured blocks, the auto-heal feature, the ability to add different types of weapons on your bot, and most recently the Random Loot Crate prize system, just completely destroyed the idea of teamwork. Before, you couldn't win a Battle Arena game without the whole team working together with their own specialisations (healers, snipers, frontliners, etc) in order to work together in battle. Now, there can be one or two enormous Mega bots with countless tech, and the rest of the team can consist of noobs who just stay back and do nothing, and that team will still win the game. Their recent update with the Random Loot Crate prizes in which you win some free weapons/blocks, replaced what they had before, which were simple currency rewards and allowed players to spend their well-earned currency on what they specifically want for their bot. Also, what they call the ""best"" player on the team (probably meaning whoever has the best K:D ratio, or highest amount of damage) receives a better crate with better prizes whereas the other teammates get the same bad crate. This increases the need for selfishness and instead of players working together to acheive the same reward, now it's just full of people fighting to be the best player on the team and not caring about their other teammates.  From the dev's perspective, if anybody wants a better experience than this (meaning better prizes from the loot crates), they're so highly encouraged to the point that they're almost forced to buy a Premium account for the game. In conclusion: Robocraft was awesome. Because Freejam seemed like they had a passion for making a great game for people to enjoy playing, without feeling left out because they're not the best player or they're not Premium. Now, Robocraft is horrible.  Because they took the fun and the teamwork out of the game and slowly made it into the opposite of what it was before, which is now just a scheme to squeeze money out of players for the developer's own wallet. This game had enormous potential, and they wasted it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: After months on end of ignoring the game, I forced myself to boot it up one more time just so I can see what's new and how the community has changed. Now I would like to declare that Robocraft has officially died. It's just not what it was before. Everything is different, in a bad way. This is, and forever will be, a perfect example of a once great game being ruined by the developer's thick-skinned greediness for money.  RIP Robocraft!!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",0
21706,Robocraft,2016.0,"After coming back to the game after a long while, I'm happy to say that the game has been improved alot. However, it still isn't even close to as good as it was in 2014. Lootcrates being the only form of getting building materials is gone. Actually, lootcrates entirely are gone. That's a step in the right direction. However, alot of new content has been added. This has caused alot of the weapons to suffer from a severe case of power creep, and has sadly made quite a few vehicles useless. Specifically, plasma bombers (Planes that rely on plasma cannons to do damage.) have been made nearly useless. Planes in general now have many counters. I.E flak guns, homing missiles, etc. I also don't like how vehicles can now have more than one type of weapon on them. This, again, destroys planes aswell as many other designs. Everyone and their mother and father is usually going to have all types of weapons on them. Now, everyone can serve as anti air, anti tank and medics. This is not good. It turns everyone into a one man army. My suggestion to fix this is to buff the original weapons, mainly the plasma launcher. Even for ground vehicles, the plasma launcher is overshadow'd by alot of the other, better weapons. Another suggestion to fix this would be to force vehicles to only have 1 type of weapon.The gamemodes are okayish. Team Deathmatch is your typical 5v5 first to 15 kills wins. The other gamemode (Going past league ranked, and PVE) turns the game into a MOBA. Which, I don't agree with. Why the good old 15v15 1 life only PVP mode is gone, I will never know. That was the best mode. My suggestion to fix this is to simply put the 15v15 PVP mode back into the game, as the primary mode.The removal of the pilot seat pretty much ruined combat, as all strategy can be thrown out the window. The bad gamemodes also means that all strategy can be thrown out the window. Now, instead of aiming for where you think the enemy pilot is, you just aim in the enemies general direction. How to fix this? Simple. Add the pilot seat back.With the removal of the requirement of a pilot seat, armour blocks have also been removed.  This only encourages people to spam blocks ontop of eachother, with no care put into them other than ""How much health can I have?"" and ""how big of a surface area can I get for all of the weapons in the entire game to fit onto my vehicle?"". Also, health blocks are free, so it's alot easier to spam health blocks. My suggestion? Bring back armour blocks, And if the devs do decide to let players use multiple types of weapons on a single vehicle, countermeasures should be added for homing missiles, aswell as flak. (I'm not sure how you would create a countermeasure for flak, but an idea for that would be a shield that can temporarily block nearby flak damage.) Also, add tiering back.Oh, and leveling up is way too easy. And you get 1 tech point per level. Take this with a grain of salt, as I ended up starting at level 51 because I had played back in the early days of the game, and thus, had started with around 50 Tech Points, which let me research alot of equipment easily. Bear this in mind, the maximum that I know one of the researchable technology costs is 5 tech points. Most of them are only 1 or 2 tech points to research. You can litterally kill no one, die 5 times and lose the game, and you'll still level up. And that's in the level 50s, imagine how fast you'll progress through the lower levels. I know this because I wanted to see if I'd actually level up like that. Which, I did. To fix this, as you probably assumed, make it harder to level up.The main good thing isn't about the game itself, it's about the developers. They actually will read a good portion of the reviews they recieve, hence why I'm going into detail about each of the main problems that the game faces. In its current state, I would not reccomend it. However, I would keep an eye on it, as the devs may fix alot of the current problems, due to how they respond to criticism in a positive manner. It may just be that I'm looking at the game through rose tinted nostalgia goggles. As the devs said in a dev blog, ""There's no 'revert to 2014' button.""",0
21707,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe latest updates of the game has turned this from okay to terrible. Before, you had different tiers in which you were out into matches with, and very rarely there would be someone from a lower tier. Now, everyone uses the same base cubes. The addition of using multiple weapons on the same bot makes this less of a tactical game, but more of a lets see how many different guns I can fit on a bot. All Freejam seem to care about is how much money they are getting from the game. The only update that I found useful were some balancing changes, when they removed the cost to repair after a game, and the CRF. It's ironic that Freejam 'Jam' with the community as they never seem to listen to the community.",0

21716,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewWhile I didn't play this for longer than a day, the absurd in-game currency prices make it either a play to win or a grind to play, or both. The idea is super awesome, and I know I would spend many hours making robots in their shop, if only I had the unlimited blocks to build. As far as the actual action gameplay, it looks really cool and has promise, but with matchmaking pairing me with experienced players(or just paying players) in unbalanced air vehicles while I'm still using default vehicles to try and get enough blocks to make or purchase a decent robot. After a solid 4 hours of straight playing, I was nowhere near having a halfway decent amount of blocks for my bot, and woefully far away from being able to get enough currency, for, well, anything. I certainly understand the appeal of this game: and I tried it despite the plethora of bad reviews it had, but really, I'm not gonna sink any more time into this. I have better games to play.",0

21718,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI ve been playing this game on and off for two or three years now and heres what i feel about the gameIn the beginning there was creativity.  I would fight other bots that resembled bad♥♥♥♥♥futuristic tanks, air and ground walkers, and bots that ressembled creations out of movies like star wars or halothere was balance in chasis cubes.  And i dont mean just the cubes i also mean armor.  You would see decent builds with a little bit of armor for protection and overall have a balanced fight in a matchHowever ive started to play again for a few matches and i was upest to find some of the keythings that made this game fun...are while not gone, slowly being used less than they originally wereI see more armored turtles with guns poking out in a match then i see a decently built, creative, cool looking battle machine these days and i think that is mostly because armor has gotten far too important in building a robotNothing seems to be balanced anymore in terms of creativity and building balance of cubes and its really upsetting because this was and still can be a really fun game to play and i dont want to see it go down the tubes just because the development teams dont do anything to bring the creativity back.That stuff on the new cover for the game is never seen in a real match.  Because if it were it would be incinerated by hovering builds covered head to toe in armor.  The creativity to make robots is still very much in the game but the matchs themselves make it impossible to win with these creative bots because they get destroyed by these other robots that are covered in parts so high in defense that they shread you to pieces before you can do some damage.So if the development team(s) ever read this then please do something about balancing out these parts so that it is not impossible to win a game creativly.  And to the people reading this review i say to give robocraft a try, its not a bad game it just can be frustrating at times.  But if you find you' re always getting frustrated and always getting destroyed in matches, then i would reccomend to just  play something else and stay updated on robocraft to see if the dev's fix these problems that have been occuring.And if you dont feel like waiting then im sorry robocraft has disappointed youthese are just my opinions on the game so please dont harass or synically bash me over the head through the internet because im trying to helpful while still positive for a game i really want to pull through.",1
21719,Robocraft,2016.0,"Edit, 8-24-2018: Thank you to all who found this review helpful. I know at the time I may not have addressed these issues in a mature fashion, but I'm glad it was noticed anyway. It's my understanding that robocraft is getting some of its old features back. While pleasant, I'll never forget the way it was those years ago. I personally will never play this game again, for a variety of reasons that have yet to be solved(though some cannot be solved).Keep protesting, players; For once in a very long time, we, the veteran minority, are heard!Original Rant:-------------------------------Oh boy, another review from XLCREEPER cause God knows if anyone wants to hear what I have to sayQuick Update: Removing megabots. I'm not even going to bother linking all of you to the monoliths of text I have written to try and save them. So, I'm done with this game.--Covering every mistake since the crumbling of robocraft, the invention of the ranked protonium battlesFirst off, you're a tad late posting that maximum loadout trailerRanting on OP Plasma BombersSecond, what went through your minds when you gave players a flak cannon to defend the OP plasma bombers, and then release missiles so you can make them OP again? The only way to protect yourself from missiles is to hide behind objects. Guess what! Bombers go OVER those objects. Not to mention they move 5 times faster than ground bots. Oh, and then you release the full weapons update, you give them BOTH plasmas and missles! What a great combination for DEATH, never ending DEATHRanting on the destruction of railgun robotsHow about when you added those ""Cray"" player model bots for driver seats? It was awesome, but when you remove driver seats altogether, it combusts the point of railgunner bots, because you're giving them less things to aim for. EXCEPT FOR THE MEGACUBE, OFCOURSERanting on the destruction of medic botsBots that orbit around that whole area are now useless, thanks to these new updates. You have a fire-rate with these now, not to mention that they do NOTHING to enemies anymore. You also shortened the range of their use and increased their proficiency by about 0.01%. OH YEAH, NOT TO MENTION THAT BOTS HEAL THEMSELVES NOWRanting on protonium ranked battles""Ranked battles will not always increase or decrease...""What ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I do proficient battles in that ranked arena FIVE TIMES to get a rank increase, but every loss seems to be a decrease. OH AND WHAT ABOUT: How leaving a protonium battle will cause you to wait two minutes, even accidental. Listen, robocraft even gives you a CONFIRMATION NOTE that you accidentally disconnected, and you still get the short♥♥♥♥♥2 minute beating of wait, just enough time to grab a cup of coffee.Finally, ranting on the obstruction of strategy whatsoeverHmmmmmmm lets see where to start with this one. Oh yeah, the removal of tiers, blocks, and all that other♥♥♥♥♥♥ Good work, because when you remove tiers and blocks and limited weapons, you remove the even thought of needed to get a challenge in building a robot. Why? Because now all you need to do is just make a ♥♥♥♥ing twig robot, throw some weapons on it, and its good to go! What happened where if you were going to build a flying robot, you'd actually need to consider and calculate how many sheilds and what weapons? Oh wait, you can put any weapon on them now. Oh wait, your robot falls too fast behind a rock to be destroyed, giving you the chance to heal yourself all fine and dandy. As for megas, you still need that goddamn strategy cause God knows that mega smg's accuracy was reduced 50% so you can't actually kill the ♥♥♥♥ing things shooting from above, which you allow 80% of the bots in a battle to be flying~Oh, and how about not restricting almost every color available to premium? And all that other stuff, of which you're bottlenecking non-premium players to pay more money~Your match making is also one unfunny joke. All those flying bots. RIP in MEGA. Ranting on what should also never have left robocraftYou never should have removed boss battles. Boss battles were the best, and I still remember those great days where 4 Teir 8 or 9 bots would fight against a whole team of little Teir 3-5's or one Megabot fighting against a battle of Teir 3-7's. But wait, Teirs don't exist anymore.﻿EDIT: Lets go over to when this game went to♥♥♥♥♥♥Robocraft Unleashed Updates:-- Maximum Freedom, just build whatever you want and take it into battle-- Completely new match-making using Robot Ranking and Player Level-- Armor restrictions lifted completely-- Tier CPU caps lifted completely-- Overtier restrictions lifted completely-- Brand new Robot Ranking gauge, with pizazz!-- Platoons now match-made based on (just above) the average Robot Ranking between the smallest and the largest Robot Ranking in the platoon-- RP rewards are now based on your performance in battle and the Robot Ranking of your Robot-- Robot Ranking re-balanced on all cubes to assist ‘match-maker’ to match Robots more equally-- T1 changed to Mk1 in names of all functional and armor cubesand all that other crap.Like freejam wrote a book on ""freedom"" and replaced their hard-drive backups with it.Here's something we all miss:http://i.imgur.com/lgZFLlt.jpg ",0

21721,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewPoorly executed sandbox building FPS. Went from intricate 10 tier system to gambling for parts. Under 50 functional cubes, the rest are nonsense cosmetics used to inflate cube count. Even if you dump money into the game, you won\'t be able to get the part you need. Over-all a poster child for bad development in the vein of StarForge and The Stomping Land.",0
21722,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewHello Players!I might be a bit biased in this review and no offence to the developers, but the game sucks. I could have given it a positive review a year ago, before the update. Before it was clear (Tiers). People played with people who are the same Tier as them, and the game was more or less balanced. I mean there was at least some balance. Of course there were some super donors who actually bought good stuff and played with you. Even if they killed you, that was fair enough. You cold just face it. And you could see by their blocks, colours and stuff how good they are and whether to evade them or fight them. The update messed up the game. Now, textures were removed, colours for each Tier block where removed and what? Yo can colour your Mark 10 (Tier 10) blocks white and everybody will attack you. And you just rek them. Also before GC (Galaxy Cash) had a higher value. You could buy a Megabot for like 5 dollars GC or could build a boog T7 for 10 euros. Like super mega Tier 7 or prebuilt magabot. Now, the cheapest crappest robot costs 30 euros, like a Call Of Duty or GTA V game. Tier system was messed up. Now worst players play with best players. Da hell? Your like T6 and a wild Megabot appears from somewhere and wrecks you, Lol? If you think differently comment. Sorry for biased opinion.Yours,Anton ",0
21723,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI may not be a super old or veteran player, but I feel entitled, as a paying costumer, to give my opinion about this game. Bad design choices, bad design choices everywhere. I won't go super detailed as some old veterans, like Juvar23, so I will just quickly comment on why I stopped recommending this game to my friends: The last update, Epic Loot, was a good idea. But they executed it in a manner that it feels like one of these mobile games with a life spam of 1-year or less, made to extract the biggest amount possible of money. It's unrewarding, it's relentless, it's not fitting for a game with the premise of BUILDING things. The issue is, the mind behind Freejam, Mark Simmons, is too dellusional over his own work to admit it's flaws, effectively leading the game to disaster. ",0
21724,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI am fully maxed out player and I'm sorry to say this but; I hate this game.Since the Maximum Loadout update teammates have been getting more and more stupid due to more reasons: - 25k Rank can be easily be reached even from level 52, which is very easy to get to- Lots of old players coming back that have gotten worse and worseThe game was perfect, but the maximum loadout just brought even more cancer; Now you can be a flak and a LOML. and a rail or even a 30 guns gunbed.I'll play again when the game isn't full of Level 50s in the highest rank possible, thanks.Although, I give this game a 7/10 due to the replayabillity, and I down vote it for the Bad players in maximum rank.",0
21725,Robocraft,2017.0,DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!! It WAS good at some point but with the crates it's a cash grabbtw I played in 2014-2015 before the crates and yes back than it had good balance and fun gameplay.But not any more. ,0
21726,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access Reviewi dont want to sound like all those people that really dont like changes but... damn. after last update (epic loot) i refuse to play this game. freejam is limiting our creativity by making crates virtually the only means of getting anything. so say you wanted a certain gun b4 the update (even a laser wasp) all you had to do was win a battle get the rp and buy the gun. now its possible to play 100 games and not get that one gun (even the weakest one!) freejam is baisically making it so you have to pay real money to progress and do what you want. if you pay for premium you get double the amunt of crate items. you can pay for a bunch of the best crates. freejam im not angry... just dissapointed if this game stays like this. i dont know if ill bother to keep it on my desktop :(x10,0
21727,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game was really interesting at the start, but all the new things ruin it. U could only use 1 weapon type and hat to aim at the beginning, nowadays u can have different weapon types, which means u can have a invincible robot cause u have anti ground and anti air cannons. Also alot of the weapons are lock on now, which also renders aircrafts rather useless especially the more fragile ones. This Game had alot of potential sadly its just a casual shooter nowadays. I can't recommend u getting it.",0
21728,Robocraft,2018.0,"Note: While most of my gameplay hours come from way back, this review is about the current state of the game, not about what it used to be.In short: Robocraft is a game, which allows considerable freedom to build creative bots and then battle it out. It's also a game which doesn't really allow much creativity if you want to be competetive. The autobalance is bad and new small bots will be matched against massive leviathans with more guns than you own. Progression tied to loot boxes (think Battlefront 2).Good sides:- Lots of tools and parts to build exactly what you want,- Many maps,- Detailed info about your bot allows for easy planning,- Supports many control schemes,- Simple pre-made start for new players,- Leaving CPU unused gives damage boost, but...Bad sides:- ...Large bots with many guns get a health boost,- All progression tied to random loot crates/luck,- Matchmaking, small bots matched with ones 10x the CPU,- No proper feeling of progression, just random,- Only 2 gamemodes (with respawn) available. Gets repetetive,Overall, Robocraft is a game which has many interesting systems, but which also doesn't support creating with them. While devs have made this game more accessible, they've also cut away so much. Bad matchmaking ensures you'll have a hard time unless you get lucky or pay up for the loot crates. Locking progression behind random chance is just the last straw.I cannot recommend this game.",0
21729,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewBefore the update the game was gold now after ive lost so much money(in game) i cant do anything. Every battle you hardly get any money and for me thats a bad thing since i have none left.,0
21730,Robocraft,2017.0,This game used to be amazing when it first released. But recently they’ve started adding really bad features like the ability to cop other peoples robots meaning that anyone can buy a good robot meaning that there is no skill required letting noobs run around with ships built by pros. I know the developers won’t see this because they would’ve changed the game so it was like the GOOD OLD DAYS,0
21731,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS, READ BELOW.This used to be a fantastic game, one of very few games where I would come back time & time again because although F2P it didn't overly push you to spend real-world money.  Well that didn't last.There was a change last year that completely unravelled all the years of hard work that FreeJam had clearly put into this great concept.  There was an epic paradigm shift that has simultaneously both screwed over long-term players who had reached a high level in this game, accruing many parts and made it near impossible for new players to have any sort of progression or great hights to aim for.  This is further compounded by the massive tilt of the game economics towards forcing people to spend money via a headlong dive into the Pay2Win model.I feel the need to remind everyone that THIS GAME IS ONLY IN BETA!  FreeJam expect people to drop serious cash on a game that is neither finished nor actually released in the traditional sense - You can spend $60 on console and receive a polished, finished AAA title with no need to spend any further cash if you don't want to.  The FreeJam business plan seems akin to Honda charging you $100,000 for a new car that isn't out yet, keeps asking for more money, it may or may not have wheels/seats/roof and degrades faster than milk.",0
21732,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewCongrats, you made a game that was once great in it's simplistic and fun nature.

A year ago it was a simplistic game with lots of potential it had the microtransactions you would expect from any f2p game but it wasnt pay to win, it would simply speed up leveling up so you could get to the point where buying 10 cubes of the next tier up didnt take 5 games. Now its just pay to win and has lost the core consept of the game where you would place the best tier cubes you could get under your piolet seat and guns and use half cubes to channel where damage would go keeping it away from your pilot seat but now it is just how many guns can you put on that you bought with real moneya good game wasted.",0

Great job, FJ.And crates... Ugh. It would take MONTHS to grind for a single legendary items, and from what I've heard even the ones you can buy have terrible chances.

21746,Robocraft,2017.0,"Fun game. ruined by P2W, and terrilbly balanced games. its rare that you get a balanced gameAfter a bit of thinking about it wouldnt really be P2W, but I feel like the pay to play aspects of it are still destorying this game. Before you actually had the option to pick out exactly what you wanted from the store which you would unlock with ingame money you earned. I will admit this was a grind but it could be done. i reached teir 9 without investing a thing into this game. and premium would get you double points for reaserching items and buying stuff. Now insteed of seeing and buynig what you actualy want to finish up your robot you're insteed thrown tons of items that you dont want at all. Lets say you try to recycle those to get the items you actully want, well you better get ready for even more grinding because you only get 1/3 of the weapons worth through recycling (unless you're premium) and even then you only get half of the items that you would if you were premium (and in my expreance all the rarest items are stuck in the premium row to really manipulate you into paying for premium) then the icing on the cake is that you are able to buy loot crates. I received 25 of these crates for free from being early access, and I received enough robobits to buy 1 legendary and received 1 epic. (25 crates costs 10$ incase anyone didnt know)To me this is far worse than P2W, because insteed of trying to get you to simply buy the best gear that you can and get it over and done with. You have to buy 100's of crates and still have to hope you get all the items you actully want.If theres any of you who even got to this point and are still thinking that its not pay to play or that what they're doing is fine I would ask you to look up what whales are for freemuim games. because thats exactly who this game is targeting to sell to.",0

21756,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game has gone from fun to terrible in such a short space of time. Initially the game was about building a robot which required you to have some skill and design ideas around it. You also had to actually aim your guns. There was a purchase system where you could purchase extra credits and premium to further on your designs or get that weapon you wanted.The most recent update to this game has brought fourth weapons you don't need to aim, robots you need no skill to fly and random chance on the blocks you to actually build your robot. But hey you can purchase crates from the pay store to hopefully complete the robot you have planned.

I played lot of this game with my friends and they liked this too. At the time there were tiers one to ten ten were the best. You did get tier stars and with those you bought upgrades to your vehicle. And with level you got more cpu. There were three weapons laser rifle plasma launcher and sniper rifle.

CROSS YOUR FINGERS AND HOPE THE RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR GIVES YOU ONE. No more simply buying a missile launcher. The crates will be filled with complete garbage you don't need and can't use 99.99% of the time. You can ""recycle"" unwanted parts(most will be unwanted) into ""robits"" that can be used to directly buy parts, but recycling yields insanely low sums of robits. It's like the pocket change you get from trading a game in to Gamestop... But even worse. Thanks to crates it's basically impossible for newer players to progress. If you want to build a better bot then you're totally at the mercy of the random number generator giving you random parts, and the USEFUL parts are rare. Imagine you want to build a flying bot and every crate you win contains everything EXCEPT wings. A crate is really just a gamble; there's a tiny chance you'll get a part you need and a very big chance that you won't. You can open up your wallet and cough up real world money to buy crates(this is how the developers, Freejam, monetize Robocraft now), but it doesn't even help. Somebody on the official Robocraft forum purchased 300 crates and he didn't even get enough parts from them to build a functional bot. Let that sink in. Crates could deny you the parts you need for months, possibly years. I don't know what Freejam was smoking. Nobody except Freejam knows that. The whole Epic Loot update should, by all rights, go down as one of the worst blunders in gaming history. Right up there with the Sega 32X. I'm not joking. The whole player base is up in arms over it and people are quitting left and right. Do not play Robocraft until Freej brings back RP. As long as the crate system exists newbies will have a terrible time, veterans will have a terrible time, everyone will have a terrible time. Robocraft is currently dead. Will Freejam realize they royally screwed up and make it rise from the ashes? Let's hope so.",0
21765,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access Reviewthis game was really fun until u released the new update now the game is base on luck it all goes around what u get in the cases ive seen a level 10 with the rocket pod thing when before the update you had to be like max level to get it i just find this game really unfair i hate it so much now also u have to spend money on the purple cases which are the best u dont have to but there so hard to get. i decided to redownload the game and try it again to see if it was any better but guess what nope still the pay to win game. i wish they would just bring this game back to what it was before all the (pardon my french)♥♥♥♥♥♥updates that there where,0

21767,Robocraft,2016.0,"This game is terrible. I have over 270 hours of game time, so id know. Myself, and many others, loved this game before. However recent 'updates' made this game awful. Items started costing millions, you made 90% less, and mega bots were removed. But wait, theres more, now its a game of chance for what items you get, new players have no chance. You need to spend hundreds to even have a chance at some good items. Also. if your not premium, you get HALF as much. The grinding after lvl 100 is unheard of. This game used to be my favorite, then maximum loadout came, then 90% nerf, then my megabot i spent hundreds of hours of grinding dissapearing within a week of getting it. Also the devs hate everyone, they ONLY want money, not good gaming expierences. So dont bother recommending things to  them. If you dont have this awful excuse of a game, dont get it. If you have it and havent considered unistalling, i dont know how. So if you dont have a free 100 hours a week for video games, or are prepared to spend hundreds, its useless. Rant over. Going to play games that accually provide entertainmentUpdated review: Ive went back to the game for a round just to see what its like, here you go. Spamming automatic lock on weapons seem to do more damage than full plasma bursts which require alot of aim. Every bot can have every weapon so theres no need for medics, snipers, tanks, or team play at all really. Im not sure whats going on with maps but the last few times ive played its been the same one, and its quite boring, you just dont get the robocraft feel anymore. This game is literally going backwards and its peak was 2014-15, STRONGLY recommend not installing this game.",0

Really like, if I want to have more pieces to keep building I either have to pla a match to get las 20 random pieces, which where no the ones I needed, or I can sell the ones I already have like... wait, wasn't I going to use those pieces to BUILD? If you get to be in the first position at the end of the match great for you, hey you get a rare loot, but what about tge people who do not care for the first places and just wanted to have some fun? So this was just my opinion, I will say good bye to robocraft for a while, have fun guys. Just got rid of it, back to war thunder",0
21771,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI genuinely used to love this game. Like this was at one point my favourite, but... after the epic loot update i am seriously contemplating uninstalling and quitting until it is either returned to its former glory or the newest update is balanced and changed drastically. some of Freejams ideas are appealing but most of them are atrocious such as the currency changes and recycler. in my opinion these ideas were only half baked before implementing and although they benefit the newer players, people like me and a lot of the veteran community have been left shorthanded. I for one demand changes before i contemplate returning to this game which in the past was a masterpiece but is now very unbalanced and unfair.  ",0

21777,Robocraft,2016.0,Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewRobocraft is a pay to win game. Enough said. Players with weapons like the auto lock on missile launcher and the aeroflak cannon are always gonna win.,0
21778,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewTL;DR: This game used to be great. However it slowly descended into incredible grindyness and reliance on random rewards outside your control.I want to preface this review by saying Robocraft used to be a good game. Combat was fun, building was fun, and your performance was influenced greatly by your skill. To an extent, it still is fun. Fighting is still fun, and so is building. But what's wrong now is progression and rewards.Before the latest update (Epic Loot) there was an RP correction patch. RP is the currency you used to by parts. Players were earning too much in certain gamemodes, and not enough in others. They were made equal, however this was still a giant difference between old and new RP rewards. This extended the time it took to buy certain end game items by hours. If you sold a part, you received exactly half the amount of RP you used to buy it.Here is the bad part: Random Rewards. As you can probably tell, RP provided an easy way to predict when you could afford a part. Robots often need four to twelve of the same piece to function correctly. Building robots was easy and fun, it didn't take long for you to slap that shiny new Anti-Air Cannon on your robot.Now you don't get RP by playing. Instead you get a crate. This crate's probabilities of getting a better item are so small, you shouldn't even try. These crates do not factor in time played or the score you get, or any other thing you do in battle. It only cares about leader board position and wether you won or not. Parts you don't want can be sold (recycled) for a set value.Crates based on leader board position is a terrible idea. Currently, everyone is fighting against their own teammates for that shiny purple crate. Killstealing, and tower stealing are extremely popular tactics. However the problem has gotten better with armorgeddon, as all crates are boosted two rarity levels, meaning many people can get the purple (protonium) crate.For some reason, sell back prices (recycle rates) for parts was greatly reduced. IIRC, there was nothing in the patch notes for Epic Loot that this would happen. Recycle rates for the cheapest block fell from 50% to 10%. The highest recycle rate for any item is IIRC 33%. This is a massive artificial extension of the time needed to complete a robot.The second worst part about this update is we have not received a reason why Epic Loot was delivered to us. Freejam is giving the illusion of communicating with their player base, by making polls for which QoL (Quality of Life) features we want implemented first. Mark, Lead designer and CEO of Freejam released an article on RobocraftGame.com, titled ""State of the game, May 2016"" Mark says he doesn't want to implement one of the changes suggested by the community: put currency in crates. He says they won't do this because he doesn't want a currency based economy. My question to him is ""Why?""Freejam's community manager reads almost all threads on the forums. At least he says he does. He doesn't always answer them. You can't expect one guy to give an answer to hundreds of threads a day, can you? He does respond to some of them, but he never responds to many threads asking why Epic Loot was made, or suggesting solutions to the problems.Mark also didn't address any other solutions to the problem. Many of which are extremely easy to implement. One solution being to raise recycle rates of all parts to 50%. No response.You could say that Epic Loot was the straw that broke the camel's back. Me being the camel, breaking meaning me writing this review. There have been many terrible updates before this one, Team Orders, and Robocraft: Unleashed are good examples.Another problem with Freejam is that they seem to think we will stop playing the game after we get to Level 150 and have a robot we have completed. This couldn't be more false. If the game is interesting, we will continue playing.Honestly, don't expect this game to get better. Freejam has never completely reverted a major update, only one small feature; Friendly fire. We don't even need a complete reversion, we just need to buff recycle rates. I've never written a steam review before, I have trouble writing essays. Just let it all flow out I guess.Even though I only have a little over 100 hours, I've played this game since October 5, 2014.To Mark, CEO of Freejam:""Why did you think loot crates and random rewards for doing well were good for this game? What was wrong with currency? Why do you think we progressed too fast in the past?""I want this game to succeed. It used to be great, the best game I've ever played! I want this game to be like that. Way back in October, 2014, the game was perfect. The core gameplay was decided on. It made sense. Regular content updates like weapons, movement parts, and most of all, maps would be enough to keep me interested. I'm sorry, I just can't recommend this game to someone without them also writing an angry review and uninstalling too.If you see me in-game, I'm likely grinding.",0

Thank god they didn't keep the insane multi-million price tags for some of the stuff, because the most common item you'll be getting is low-tier gadgets and blocks, neither of which are worth a lot.Gun energy seems to be whacked. Being unable to shoot with more than half of the energy bar left is annoying at best and infuriating at worst.The devs care little of their game and their players and instead resort to petty excuses and dismissing reviews (like this one) and comments as ""boring"".Weapons are not balanced, especially considering the lag compensation system is not going to help you. How do you like getting shot through mountains?The screenshots on the store page are deceptive and are not up to date. For instance, the medic gun (which looks like it shoots continuous beams) DOES NOT DO DAMAGE ANYMORE.The worst part about the game though, is the playerbase. While it is true that they have complained about many things that really weren't all that important, that is not what makes them bad. Some people say that the players are actually 'better' than those in LoL or DOTA 2, but do not be fooled - the players here are victims of a lobotomy gone horribly wrong. You will face teammates that are insanely incompetent, making you wonder if they have ever TOUCHED A COMPUTER BEFORE. You will RARELY be matched with half-decent or even good teammates.

How much longer does this ""alpha"" stage need to go on? As long as the excuse can be abused?The removal of tiers, the tech tree, the megabots - some people were not too happy with it.

21785,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewSigh, how would I be able to explain how BROKEN Robocraft has become?(Akward pause)Well let's start with the pros:*Based off center of math and SCIENCE*Player made robots*Community factory to sell copys of your robots*Actual weight to blocksNow on with the cons*There are A LOT of cons, but here's one:ALMOST EVERYTHINGLet me explain. I have played this game for so long and I'm dissapointed about how much of a mess Robocraft has become. I'm sorry to say but, I don't like it anymore. There are constant updates so that robot you just finished making, the next day, a update comes out and guess what, That robot you spent five hours working on renders useless. I created my bot many years ago and yet, I didn't even think about what I was building. It was a burger colored caterpillar, I slapped some guns on it, gave it some wings and BAM, called it a robot.But there is something a bit worse now: balance. The game ""supposedly"" says: ""Please wait while we match you fairly with other players"". That is a straight up LIE. You could create some high tech 5 areoflak cannon bomber and be matched with new players. It's super unfair and it drives away players. FreeJam, get yourself together and bring back Tiers!Ever since FreeJam introduced the Community Factory, It has been a complete flop for me. It meant the richer players could make their robots have a 5 star combat rating and make them even richer, while those with limited funds, are stuck with the lower star robots, making little to no Robits off their robots. Guess what the first thing you look for when you go to the Community Factory, a good robot. So Robocraft shows almost only 5 star combat rated robots. And only the rich can buy them, leave the less rich to have to dig deep to just find a cheap, decent, robot.All these robots are being sold for over 120k robits! How are you supposed to make that much? It seems the only way is to either churn out money for that robot, or simply play match, after match, after match. Clan seasons are my main revenue of robits now. Your only choice to get that much is to either play for crates and hope you get good stuff to sell in the recycle, or you have to cough up them dolla dolla bills to buy a ship full of platinum crates and sell EVERYTHING you get from those crates.I can't reccommend this game until it's more balanced and gives robits whether or not you win or lose a match.

21787,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI remember this game being fun in 2014 before the devs started to phase out the veteran player base in favor of casual gamers.

Then they started to chip away all those little things that made Robocraft unique and enjoyable untill only a shallow husk of it's former glory remained.There are many reviews here that describe the step-by-step process the devs took to ruin Robocraft so for the sake of keeping this short i recommend you to read them instead. As for the future of Robocraft, nothing good can come of the ""new"" direction that the devs decided to take the game in. As of late 2015 the game has been slowly dying, i only hope that the devs see reason and restore it back to the way it used to be before it's completly dead.

21798,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI remember when I played this game for the first time. I thought it was cool that it had these new concepts that I learned thanks to my friend, but this new update ruined all of that. I was excited to get back into Robocraft after at least a year of not playing it due to little mention from my friend, but when I heard how sad and angry he was, I new that the game me and him loved was gone. I played the update for 15 minutes and I already knew it wasn't the same at ALL, and the fact that they probably don't listen to us makes it even worse. I'd rate this game up if it were back to the good old times, and sure I sucked at the game, but my friend was great at it, he spent maybe 100 dollars on the game and now all e gets is crap. please, PLEASE, if you are reading this, if the creators are reading this, FIX. THIS. GAME. Thank you.",0
21799,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThs game is a lot of fun and the combats are usually pretty competitive.All was fine until the epic loot update and they removed the RB rewards for matches (used to buy whatever parts you want) and replaced by a random drop system.The random drop system is not fun at all since you can play for a good while without ever getting parts you will actually use and instead getting a ton of useless parts.  You then recycle them at 1/10th of the part value and end up getting maybe 1 usefull part per 10 to 20 matches.I totally recommend this game as it is fun, but be prepared to be ""incentivize"" more than ever to buy premium status.  And even with premium you still get that sad random drop system.Because that is such a turn off for me, I have to give a thumb down to the game at this point.I really, REALLY hope they will bring back the RP system, and if they ever do, I will be extremely happy to review this review :)",0
21800,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe gameplay isn't very good to begin with, the matchmaking is completely unbalanced, crafting your robot is even ruined with the terrible RNG crate system, which was either put in place in an attempt to make the game worse or an attempt to squeeze more money out of its player base with what is essentially gambling. On top of that is the premium membership, which ties in with the crate system and the crafting system to squeeze out even more money from its player base. Premium membership isn't a one time buy, it requires a subscription like an MMO. The subscription options range from a few days to six months. After every match you get a crate with some items. Better types of crates have a higher chance for rarer items, you get better crates from being higher on the scoreboard and on the winning team in a match. You get more items per crate depending on the type of match you play. Match types that generally take longer give more items. The items you get are completely random. And if you're not a premium member you only get half of the items per crate, so if you happen to get a good item in a locked off row and you're not premium, it's gone. This is of course meant to encourage people to pay for premium, but it's more likely to just drive players away from the game.Even with premium (which I had for 3 days) you mostly get garbage, even after hours and hours of grinding the same poorly balanced match types over and over again. There is a way to get more crates without grinding for hours though, of course you can buy them with real life money. So if you want to get a lot of items, some of which would hopefully be good, you can pay for a few days of membership, then pay for several of the highest tier crates, then hope you get something you actually want. On top of that most of the paint colors are restricted to premium members only. So if you want to paint your robot anything other than white, dark gray, light blue, and orange, then you've got to pay for premium.Of course you don't have to pay for anything, you could go on just playing the game. But that leads to the worst part yet. The game play. The movement feels clunky and the combat is bad. By that I mean weapons, at least the ones you start with, have terrible accuracy, especially at long range. This can still be sort of enjoyable when you're up against robots with similarly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons, but like I said there's no balance in the matchmaking. Any weapon/part goes for any game mode. They only match based on the robot's CPU score. Each item has a CPU cost, stronger/rarer weapons have a slightly higher CPU cost than weaker basic weapons. However if you build your robot with just the basics, like a helicopter rotor attached to a powerful missile launcher (the missiles lock on by the way) or a rail gun to a few blocks flat on some wheel's/treads/whatever, you can easily get matched with new players using robots with much weaker weapons which most likely can't even hit you reliably from the range you're hitting them. Another common annoyance is people using small, fast robots which hover or fly around you firing some sort of homing weapons, which mean their robot can constantly be moving quickly and erratically while always hitting you because they don't have to worry about aiming. And even if you do land a lucky hit, they'll just heal fully if they don't get hit again within ten seconds. While you probably won't be able to heal because they never miss with their homing weapons constantly chipping away at you. The only real way to counter this would be to build a similar robot assuming you have the parts. Even if you did though, does that seem like fun? A bunch of people just mindlessly flying around holding down the left mouse button until one team wins. Not exactly great gameplay.Even if all of that sounds good to you, the only way to get better weapons and parts is to keep playing these poorly balanced matches over and over again for hours till you hopefully get the parts you want/need. Or until you get enough garbage to “recycle” for anything from less than 1% to about 30% or 40% of what each of your items is worth (destroying your items in the process of course) then finally getting enough in game currency from all that crap you spent all that time grinding for to finally afford some of the ridiculously expensive items from the in game shop. You can do all of that to see if maybe the game gets a bit more enjoyable. Or you can just play a different game.",0

21803,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFreejam has completely removed any kind of progression from this game and turned it into that of digital gambling. You can no longer pay real money to get exactly what you want. You now pay real money to gamble on crates. Because they removed RP in favor of Robits, the only way to make money is to recycle the random junk that you get from crates at 1/4 their value. This heavily increased the time it takes to get a single item that you may want. This game is no longer about experimenting with new builds, it's about gambling your time away on random junk. Epic Loot? More like Epic Fail. Also the removal of the damn Tiers & Tech System changed the game It wasn't about who was the highest anymore after the removel of the tiers. Everything could be obtainable by anyone making matches quick and utterly boring. Worst update yet.Robocraft: BIG FAILURE AFTER EPIC♥♥♥♥♥♥UPDATE",0
21804,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis was a great game until the loot system was introduced...Why? For one, they took away the level lock system which made everything fair, now some level one can get an incredibly over powered weapon but still be matched with bots around his CPU.Secondly, there is no more economy to this game, the idea was completely scraped. The economy made it fun because I could buy whatever part I needed to make my dream bot come to life, now it's hoping I will get a decent part that I can actually use on my bot.Thirdly, the premium system doesn't work well with this update, there's not much there to pull you into buying it, I either miss 4 extra parts from BA or one extra part from Deathmatch.These are just my opinions, but they truly did ruin a great game and a lot of my friends have stopped playing.Update:I know alot of popular games like LoL and such are adding crates or similar mechanics to the game but if you've actually noticed, they haven't thrown their whole economy done the drain, the crate mechanic is a seperate feature that player can do if they desire to.Also it wouldn't be that hard to bring back that good old leveling scheme and still having a crate mechanic, all you would have to do is literally just limit what the lower levels can get, it really isn't that hard to do. I'm really just sick and tired of seeing low levels being able to two-shot eachother, it takes away all the fun.",0

21816,Robocraft,2016.0,"Original 2016 Review:I had to put way too many hours into this game before realizing how unbalanced and glitchy it was.

But hey, if you wanna give it a shot, it's free, and that's your choice.Edit Nov, 2018: I've moved towards more of a 6/10 over time, but I'm still not changing my review to recommended.Having more colors to choose from for non-premium users is nice.

I have been a loving player in this game, however the status of the game is P2WNG (Pay to Win Nothing Good). Its horrible, spend a bunch of money, get nothing good. Spend no money, get nothing good.

And balance issues  are understandable, I stuck with the game through those issues because hey, its hard to balance a createive game.But the most recent change where all of your income is basically a roll of the dice, no skill required, has done it for me. It's clearly set up so that you can buy ""boxes"" or cash to buy parts outright, but you can no longer simply rely on your skill level to ensure a good income level.

You cannot leave that screen because the timer will restart, extending your punishment. This is an awful punishment because you either have to wait 10-20 minutes of losing the game or 5 minutes before joining another one (or just play an actual good game, it's up to you).Punish the player by taking away the reward from the next match and allow players to leave matches! Don't force players to play a game like a parent tries to force their kids to eat their vegetables!YOU'RE NOT MY REAL DAD!",0
21823,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access Review2017 Update:Tried Robocraft out again for a few hours. To see where progress has been made or lost.As predicted, most changes are made due to the dwindling playerbase. This explains why in the past they removed barriers to matchmaking like Tier Divisions, Level affected matching, reducing the amount of players per team etc.I joined now to find that they've further made changes that exacerbate imbalanced matches by removing level requirement to unlock CPU, giving everyone the same CPU allotment at maximum and allowing bots of any CPU mixture to play together. It simply totals up the CPU on a team and makes it match up on the other team. The problem with this is, it inevitably ends up where you'll have one team with CPU evenly spread among them ranging from 1.4k to the maximum and the other team will be full of scouts with a single person at maximum cpu.The game still suffers mobmentality wipeouts and favors it to be played as so. As much as there are cries of tactics are valid, nothing still beats team rushing.Sadly though, these changes have done nothing to help new players, against old hats like myself and even older hats who understand Triforcing and damage mitigation, which is near gone, most resorting to either sheer bricks upon bricks or mobility evasion (read; drones). Only played a dozen matches today, lost one and thats because I decided to use a stupid bot you'd expect a noob to (one megaleg, rocket launcher, shield gen, thats it.) and even then, it was a close loss.The ultimate kick to the teeth though, is the changes to the Battle Arena mode, specifically, the ""Imbalance Detected"" system, where it will cause Protonium to spawn on the map. If the enemy destroy it, they instantly equal the progress the winning team has made.All this serves to do is infuriate the winning team and delay the match even further, as the losing team may have now equalised, but is still on a losing footing control point wise. If the losing team choose to ignore the Protonium and focus on the control points, again.. theyre still on a losing footing.As it stands Robocraft has an average weekly player base of 3,000 spiking 6,000. In 2014 it was 14,000 spiking 25,000. Lets see how you fare in 2018 Freejam. If youre even still around.2016 Update: FJ are now trying to censor negative reviews as ""abusive"" even if they are not.https://twitter.com/TomCat__86/status/746665833414332420I give up with Robocraft.TLDR; Robocraft devs don't know what they want their game to be. They've tried DM/TDM, E-Sports, Creative Building, MOBA, Player Choice Progression, Forced progression, bland progression. Each and every update drastically changing how the game plays and nullifying ANY work players have put in to creating their bots.They establish one set of rules only to change them a few months down the line under the guise of ""Balancing"" or enabling ""player creativity"" and doing the complete opposite.Not to mention the game has flaws from years ago still not fixed and now being hidden by new changes. For example MM being broken turning it into ""Who has the most medics, wins""and hiding the poor matchmaking by removing robot classification ""because not all bots were classified correctly"" (translation, 1 in maybe 100 were wrong, and ""its haaaard."")Edit to include the latest update (Max Loadout) - Again FJ don't understand normal development practices. They threw in MASSIVE changes all at once and are no sat scratching their heads wondering why it broke. Flak is bugged (DMG), Nano is bugged (LMB+RMB = superspeed heal), MSMGs are bugged (free aim firing, without LOS), matchmaking is atrocious (still), Blink and DSM are stupidly expensive (Both RP/GC and CPU). They should have done a slow implement of these changes one by one to iron each minor kink, instead of this.-------------------------------Too many wild changes, one step forward two steps back is this developers motto.Robocraft initially had a sensible mixture of Creativity and Function. There was also a sensible mix of Grind, Progression and sense of achievement. It was a little lacklustre in places. For example, the RP system allowed you to choose what you unlocked and the level system determined how ""effective"" those unlocks were. As you progressed in Level and CPU, your bots got bigger, your weapons better.This has now been swapped out for a system where equipment is unlocked in order, over time with no player input. Once you unlock an item, that is it, theres no improvement. Everything is by default ""Tier 10"".This in turn made building robots boring, no more balancing weaponry vs armor vs mobility. If you chose to go cosmetic-bot there was a challenge to making a bot functional but in ""theme"".Now sure you can build a bot ""exactly"" as you want, as long as you like Yellow, Pink, White, Grey & Brown as your color palette. The other colours are locked to premium (Note they touted this ""flattening"" of tiers as an 'improvement' to creative robot building).Then theres the slew of problems with actual Gameplay mechanics.Initially there were balancing issues as expected, they kind of balanced themselves out up until Unleashed/Legendary update and the devs got stuck in a nerf cycle on everything except SMGs.This last update saw them add the near useless flak, severely nerf the Medics Nano and turned it into SMGcraft again.They also did away with many of the useful gameplay information elements.Spotting now just says ""Enemy Spotted"" with no indication of flier, hover, walker, they claimed this is because bots were ""complicated to classify"" yet for the most they were classified correctly. This means you find it far harder to prioritise the right targets.This also affects your own team negatively as you can no longer easily see if a friendly medic is nearby or if a push block is Rail Heavy and needs more SMG or plasma.The game has also suffered Match making issues from day one. Resulting in differing metas.The latest of which is ""The Team who has the most medics, wins"". The hiding of Bot Type and spotting call outs I think was done to merely hide how bad the matchmaking is, especially as in the past when we could see the team makeups we would see matches where it was 6 rails and two plasmas vs say 6 SMGs and two medics.Put simple, the devs have taken this game in far too many directions, too rapidly and with no forethought.Initially it was a DM/TDM game, then they opened it up to the Creative Block Builders, then expanded to Boss Battles (removed, was one Megabot vs lots of little bots quite fun), then switching to try their hand at MOBA-like Tower matches, then trying to create some kind of bespoke ""Robot Market"" where players can sell their bots, but their currency system is too expensive to support.Its like they saw all these good ideas from other games and tried to cram it into their own, trying to snap up a bit of another niche in gaming and half assing it so badly that it introduces more problems than it gains in players.This is likely the reason why they ""flattened"" their game down to basic progression.",0
21824,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewSo you might have read a bunch of reviews already about how freejam messed up the game and have continued to downgrade this game. And you also might be turned off because a lot of those review are by people who played this game A LOT. Well they're all right. I used to play this game whenever I didn't have a enw game to play, because it was consistantly fun. Sometimes i'd get burned out but then i'd come back because the only limit to what you could build was pretty much what you thought up. New ideas, more gameplay. But now it's nothing like it used to be. I'll list quickly the reasons for my dissatisfaction.First - No more tier system, everything is linear.Second - They took away the pilot seat (the core of the robot) and just say that if you drop below 25% hp you die.Third - They killed off healers, if you can hide for 10 seconds without shooting, you auto heal almost immediatley, so healers are irrelevant.Fourth - They changed cubes without compensation (of which i should have gotten a lot) and completly ruined my favorite bot because of the change in cubesFifth - To go with the auto healing, there is now this one type of bot that takes forever to kill, but never stops moving. In other words, it attacks, flys away, gets full health and attacks again. It's just so annoying that i quit the game after seeing 5 on the other team.sixth - It's just not the game that they had origionally gotten known for, and they continue to degrade it. Conclusion - If you want to play this game and form your own opinion go for it. just know that it is a HUGE grind with littel reward now, and they might decide they don't like stuff and junk it so don't get attached.P.S. Just in case someone is reading this thinking ""o he just doesn't want to make new things and keep up with the game"" that's not true. I have loved that they updated their game, but this specific update is terrible. It made the game basic and boring, from both a builders and a shooters point of view.",0

21832,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewRobocraft used to be my favorite free game on Steam. Creative, fun gameplay. Now though, if you want to play Robocraft, you have to install a piece of third party software called ""EasyAntiCheat"" to play. As far as I can tell, EasyAntiCheat is a keylogger and a screencapper that periodically posts both screenshots and chat logs from the game, with an accompanying username, to a public database. EAC is flagged by most antivirus software, and for good reason - it is blatantly spyware that compromises users' privacy.I am deeply disappointed at the developers' decision to carelessly disregard their users' privacy, and will not play Robocraft or any other FreeJam game again until I am allowed to play without downloading intrusive third party software. Sadly, I cannot recommend this otherwise excellent game to anyone who cares about their privacy.",0

21834,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI wouldn't say I'm obsessed with Robocraft, but whenever I re-discover it in my Steam Library it's like Christmas has come early. Even with over 100 hours of action, I'm still not bored. The game is constantly evolving, as you, the player do. As you rank up both your account and your robots, it brings  a whole new element to the game, because you have more parts to play around with, and an increased block cap. With new parts released regularly, there's always something to build every time you log on. 10/10",1

But changing the whole game is not like updates should be.",0
21836,Robocraft,2015.0,"This is my first negative review for a game ever, and it hurts me to do so on this game but the dissapointment is too much - FREEJAM... What a shame - PLEASE fix your terrible new tiering system out, you completely killed robocraft with it. Until then, I have very little motivation to play. I have played with friends since first release, LOVED IT. Got over T10+, stopped for a while and we said to each other that ""we can't wait to play it in a while and see it grow and mature""... 1 year later, we try it again updated, excited to show additional friends too... but wait, it's not Robocraft anymore - it's truly Robocrap. The spirit of classically, easily and understandably levelling up (to all types of end-users) has died... you could even say this pretty much isn't even a proper objective-based level-up game anymore, now it's just some weird kind of open-world-free-for-all-matchmaking-CHAOS that is really frustrating and just doesn't make sense.Robocraft is now literally a sinking ship - soon on it's way to 'Mixed' reviews on Steam. This game could have been a timeless classic, and it still can be. Would love to delete this review and leave a recommended one, make it happen. I'll be watching carefully, and honestly if it's not fixed soon I'll be very sad to see this once-a-great-game be uninstalled from my library.*EDIT/UPDATE 1* - For people who say I'm hating, I'm not, I still love the game and I'm actually still playing it, if you haven't played the game since it's initial release you won't understand. Trust me, if you played the pre-updated versions you would say, “why did they ever change it?!” ... I just cannot recommend Robocraft anymore - yes it WAS a fantastic game, but anyone can make any robot now and the matchmaking will 90% of the time put you in an extremely unfair game - the tiering system is completely messed up making the whole aim of the game pointless... the achingly painful feeling of spending hours on building an awesome robot only to find it is put into games with MUCH more powerful robots is depressing, confusing and just pure torture :(*EDIT/UPDATE 2* (29/09/2015) - I was just playing Robocraft all last night, woke up this morning and wow... just WOW - FREEJAM what are you guys even doing?! A few days ago I made this review and it made it to the steam store page and I hoped maybe you guys would feel my outrage, but nope, you go and add even more ridiculous updates. In the last update you made it so that only high level robots can do TDM, a week later, without any word of warning again, without letting the community know what your doing you switch the whole thing around for a week? and your excuse is, ""so we can make more games available for everyone""... :| :| :| LOL HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?! At least come up with better excuses. Seriously, let us know more about what your doing and working on, you should be serving your consumers, making votes and poll's, making us feel part of the development, instead you don't listen to suggestions and complaints and you act like Gods who use their consumers as lab rats. I'm not even playing this week because of today's update. You know, I didn't even know who you guys were until your over-tampering with the game, your presence in the game makes me feel nauseous and I had to find out who was causing it, how sad is that? I should be searching you guys up because of how awesome you guys are as developers, and yes you guys were good initally, but your test of integrity failed badly. How can you not see your ruining the game? It's like you guys sweat on your monitors so much that you can't see your screens anymore. Take a break, have a shower and clean it all up.Sorry if I seem harsh xD I'm just ranting on, BUT STILL, the truth is always harsh. :) Anyway just remember I'm willing to forgive and forget and venerate you guys as one of the best indie game developers ever for making the awesome game that is Robocraft if you just sort out all these unnecessary updates, kthnxbye :D (Y)*EDIT/UPDATE 2* (02/04/2018) - I just realised I predicted years ago that Robocraft would go down to ""Mixed reviews"" status on Steam and I checked back today and it is a solid Mixed. I installed the game again to see if there were any improvements and oh... my.... there are no words to desribe how bad and messed up the game has become. I've never seen any other game become this ruined before! I would predict that this game would go to ""Mostly negative"" however all the current players probably never played the original Robocraft. I uninstalled the game immediately, but it's sad, a part of me still misses the old version and I would love more than anything to play it again.",0

Im leaving this review because they are finally making the game good again, bringing back tiers and removing crates, bringing back the old tech tree system, i believe that with this update people might be able to play the good version of robocraft again. so if your looking into this game, since its free, just try to take a look at it, its an amazing game!

I'm all for a bit of variety and quirky building, but to have my tactical designed Mech, that I spent a lot of time and care on  destroyed in an instant by a flying square on acid is really rediculous!Matches need to be fairly matched, based on equal levels and equal amount of robot type. Say 3 Mechs+ 3 tanks or Wheel vehicals and no more than 2 drones /planes/ helis ect a side, that would at least even the odds and build a little tactical advantage for both parties.I love the creativity i can put into this game and do enjoy playing it. Would it be at all possible to allow co-op in the practice range against the AI bots? This would be a nice change of pace from constant deathmatches with little reward and of course players could always have a mode where they work against each other whilst fending off the AI bots and accumulating the best score?Please sort this great game out and win back all the other players that have left disgruntled, ( just read the comments) I can't believe this games review says Very positive, I think a recount is in order, dont you?P.s single player crashes all the time loosing you progress, somtimes after 20 kills, everytime after one death or beating your high score by more than 25-30 kills, please fix thisThanks",0
21842,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI probably got Robocraft around early-2015. It was really fun. You build a car, tank, whatever, go out in battle, shoot some people, get shot by people, die horribly, and redesign. That's how it works. I loved it. You get tech points and RP from battles, and unlock stuff with your tech points on the tech tree - There's decisions to be made. Unlock the next tier of wheels or the radar jammer? New armor or new wings? Tank or plane? There's paths.Well, that's how it was. Now you just unlock random crap every time you level up from a battle.I haven't even played this awful game in a while, and I'm probably glad I haven't.From reading other reviews it looks like this game has continued going downhill. Fast.They had an amazing idea down for a game. It was popular. I voted for it as best indie game 2015. And then after that every update I'm like ""Why? Why did you go and do that? It was fine before!""You know, back in 2015, what was really fun was having one design I always used. My SMG tank with like 3 different armor levels. As I got RP I would buy more cubes to replace lower tier armor. And that tank was awesome, in my mind. It was probably pretty crap, but I didn't care. As long as I got a couple kills I was happy. But nope, they changed everything, and reset everyone's progress for like the third time.. I couldn't even get back into it at that point.Honestly, I just don't know what to say any more. This fun and amazing game that I would spend 5 hours straight playing every day has turned into something I don't ever want to even look at. I hate it.Hell, I even made a positive review for this game months back - because it was a good game. I then of course deleted that review after realizing how bad it's gotten.Sorry for this wall-of-text of a review, but I'm just sharing my thoughts.Freejam, get your s*** together. Please. You have an amazing game but you're ruining it. ",0
21843,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access Reviewi dont like the new currency system. before the update i had a decent amount of money but then the update happens and its like im super poor now. i preferred the old system of buying blocks with money you earned. i dont like that they got rid of the tech tree because now any rich enough player just has access to anything they want. overall i think they changed the games currency and leveling system too much and it takes all the sense of progression  out of the game and for a game like this that is pretty important.,0

21845,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewIt's been about a year since I wrote the original review. Somehow just about everything changed and I still have the same gripes with the game I had back then as now. Balance issues persist, drones still reign supreme over all other bot types, and matches still feature people who routinely disconnect and other network issues. Meanwhile the main initiative Freejam has taken on improving their game is to advance Robocraft into 'Beta' which apparently entails throwing everything relating to game modes out the window and changing the point of the game from destroying enemy bots to standing on rings, blasting crystals, and endlessly punishing bots with slow mobility. What's funny is that in the face of all that, they only slightly tweaked a few balance points about the more broken weapons and mobilities to be less outstanding (and to their credit, in response to a lot of player feedback over the past several months as well), but the rush and apparent decision to enter beta and somehow trash every single map they had developed for the game up until that point just kind of pulled the rug out from under everything and shifted the game balance even more weirdly off center.There's a ton good about this game - robot construction is flexible and stable enough to let players build in just about any shape or configuration and have a functional fighting machine. A combination of paint and various block shapes allows players to construct bots with legitimately pleasing aesthetics and just really cool shapes. The decisions that players make in setting up their vehicle carry over directly into gameplay as well, with the unexpected structural weaknesses and exposed weapons being prime targets for skilled players to shoot in lieu of 'headshots'. At its core, Robocraft is a game with sophistication and reactive tactics in terms of how to fight with basic marksman weapons, and this is an element of the game that has thankfully survived intact ever since I started playing the game back in 2014 - when there were still cockpits and a weird tech tree. Even with all the new weapons they're trying to push, my favorite guns are the Laser (SMG) and Railgun (Sniper Rifle), which both emphasize careful aiming the most of all weapons. In terms of effectiveness though, Ions (Shotguns) and large Plasmas (Grenade Launchers) currently reign supreme.With everything I've seen, I simply don't believe that's how Freejam sees their own game. I still cite one of their mislead past decisions that thankfully didn't carry through - a recalculated damage system where it wasn't possible to damage components or immobilize enemies aside from just stripping off their whole chassis and vaporizing the whole bot. That was a decision that, if it had actually gone through, would've killed one of the main redeeming factors of its gameplay for me. Reflecting on it, it really illustrates what I think I've come to realize, and it's that Freejam just doesn't know what they want from their game, and still cannot recognize what they're trying to go for. It has no mission statement. Instead, they are mostly trying to blindly follow the leader and seem to be focusing a lot of their attention on making the game more 'accessible' to a wider demographic. That really could just be what Robocraft is, though. They might've just sat down one day and said 'what if we combined Minecraft with World of Tanks?' and somehow it worked for about 2 years. With how much I do like the game's potential, though, I really hope this isn't the case.",0
21846,Robocraft,2017.0,"Game feels extreamly clunky as weapons and tools given are lackluster and offer little to gameplay, loading screens, fervent bug and errors continuously distrupt the game on a daily basic( at least when I played). Building a robot is intricate but takes a while to hype up into a proper bot to evenly fight with others as sheild loot is way to random, meaning putting sheilds on your robot ends in a cluster of garbago. Sound is horendously loud even when turned down to minimal settings, what makes this worse as sound is unaccessable mid-game. Otherwise game runs smoothly and details are added in the smallest of places, which adds a unique mise-en-scene in the environment. Game probably needs a better progression system and divercity of loot to give it some extra zing. 5/10",0

The retention rate is higher because new users are logging in daily for their free crate.

21858,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe main emphasis on this game is that you get to create and build robots with different methods of locomotion and weapons types. It's a game aimed towards the creative mind. You're given different types of cubes and connection rods to act as armor, and when they're gone, you're either done with the match or respawn at extending intervals, depending on which game type you picked.However, lately Freejam decided to make a random reward system. This system really handicaps the idea of creating things and rather than allowing freedom for the player to make what they want, the developers seem more focused on monetary gains with membership ""premium"" status and an optional crate buying system, reminiscent of  mobile games. Although not ""Pay - to - Win"" technically, it's a literal gamble on what parts you'll get. And this is what stiffles the game. It's a game that wants people to build something, but detrimentally handicaps them by giving them a crapshoot of mostly unuseable pieces. (You might get an idea to build a cool bot, but are given a ski and a China flag. And you might have even paid for it)Also, there doesn't seem to be any foreseeable endgame planned and content releases are slow/ slight variations of previous ideas. (One new map added as of this writing)Matchmaking has been addressed, but it's still lopsided at times.

21866,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewPros. 1. A unique game with a fair amount of weapons. 2. The weapons are balanced ok at the moment. 5/20/2016 (see con 4)Cons.1. Spawning is inconvinent at best, you can spawn right infront of an enemy and vice versa. 2. Premium is too expensive. 3. You can get the most kills and do the most damage while dying the least and you will somehow lose, a very unintuitive scoring system. This occurs even when your account is premium. 4. Constant updates alienate veteran players.Verdict: It's free-to-play, keep it that way for yourself.",0

21868,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewGreat concept, horible execution, devs pratically ignorant to those who don't have a hole in their wallet.I've played this freemium game at 2 different points in time, and I regret re-installation.Teams are balanced against each other, but your teammates often have way more or less power (roughly measured by amount of cpu) than you (ie 400-700 cpu bots in matches with 1500+ cpu bots), meaning you have to recognise who you should run from, and who should to run from you in order for a ""balanced"" match, despite people just attempting to blast anyone into rubble. Sure, you can recycle your unwanted parts for points you can use to buy parts you want, but the porportion of scrap you get for a part is so low that you could grind for 6 hours always getting 2 of the best quality crates per match (this asumes you win and be the highest on the scoreboard) and you'd still not have enough for a blue quaility part (part rarity at lowest to highest is white, green, blue, purple, orange). Premium time allows you to skip the slower-than-a-snail pace of grinding for those extra parts in the crate that they dangle in front of you but are locked behind a paywall, as well as a more recent 3x recycle points which should be the base rate for recycling for those who don't want to spend any money, as well as 12 more paint colors that people could easily do without.Will likely leave you annoyed, frustrated, and dissapointed as it did me.",0

21874,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewTL:DR - Get it if you have nothing better to play. Otherwise, move on.Back when i first started playing this, about 2 years ago, this game was actually pretty neat. It was 'Robocraft'. You build your bots, go into battle, get RP, buy more parts and improve your bot. You could go into a battle and see unique bots all over. Some sucked. Some were OP. Some were simply ridiculous.Fast forward to now. With the CRF introduced, it's not so much Robocraft as it is Robo'copy-n-paste'. I see one awesome design in one match. Cool. Next match i see a similar design but with rearranged electroplates. Then i see one with different weapons. Suffice to say, people aren't as encouraged to build their own bots as they were pre-CRF. Still not that bad. I mean, they can copy the bots but i'm still building mine from scratch.The addition of Flaks, and all updates henceforth, spelt the death of this game. Current state of the game? Build a tanky ground bot, or get rekt (buy big shotgun). Build a small and fast flyer that is capable of retreating easily, or get rekt (by big flak cannon). The number of 'viable' builds in the game has been greatly limited to giant ground tank, or small/fast flyer. No more flying tanks. No minimen. It's just, for lack of a better word, pathetic. Flaks just knock you down no matter how tanky your plane is. An easy fix for this would be if FreeJam did something sensible and, a) decreased flak firerate or b) decreased the damage. But it's FreeJam, when've they ever listened to player input? Thank god for FreeJam that the LOML (Lock-on Missile Launcher) isnt too bad after recent nerfs. Not even gonna get started on the shotgun.INB4 ""Make better bots you noob""Fair point. Maybe i should make better bots. Now i just need more cu-- NOPE. In order to get cubes/weapons/parts, i'll need to head into battle. In order to get good stuff i need to place high up. To place high up, i'll need... oh no... a better bot!!11!?!?!?1? See where i'm going? With the old RP system, I could've easily gone into battle, farmed cash, then bought whatever i needed at the time. Now i play with a sh17b07, get low rank, then get more sh17 to place on sh17b07. Oh how do i get out of this loop? :c. By spending cash on the stacks of protonium boxes obviously (which i'll note, does not guarantee at least one decent item).End of Review/Rant/Rantview - FreeJam needs help. Whatever they're trying, or tried, to make of this game is far out of sight, and can never be reached because they took the wrong train to crapland.",0

21879,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewAvoid until fixedPlayed first in 2014, kept playing and got the 2015 robo. It is a fun game with great potential... However the netcode and connection issues make this game the most infuriating game to play. Once you DisConnect from the game, you're stuck in limbo for the rest of your match with no one moving, none of your hits displaying damage, and being unable to quit the match because the developers simply refuse to put that functionality in the esc menu. However dispite not appearing to do anything, your shots and positioning of your vehicle after a DC still Affects the Game through ""Ghosts"". Damage you deal in DC limbo keeps damaging still connected players, and if you park on the capture point You Will be counted as capturing and your oppenents will lose the game to an invisible capper.The build aspect is fun but handicaped in the epic loot update, restricting your build options to random drops from loot crates. You can forge parts you want however the currency required comes from recycling random drops which gives next to nothing.All in all it's a game with great potential but is handicapped in so many ways that it is at best Infuriating to play, and at worst completly unplayable.

21880,Robocraft,2016.0,"Ive played this game for 250+ from around the get go and the latest update has just ruined this game. The developers have been throwing hour grinding new gear and weapons for the past month which contribute nothing to the game (the blink generator is cool but thats all), nothing of what this game needs. The weapons need rebalancing after they messed with them in previous updates, and the simplification of the tech tree is awful, its just a grindfest. I dont mind grinding but i want to get something decent out of it to make it feel worth it and with the removal of the Megabots theres nothing driving me to continue playing.The developers have ruined a once great game.No Megabots, No point playing.",0

The megabots update was incredible, it added a new challenge, a way to get massive amounts of money, and once you got there it was a last. After seeing how happy people were, the demons at freejam then decided to remove them as it was making TDM ""unbalanced"". Now all you see is missile carriers with lock on craps, and practicly invinsible bots that only focus on shielding and spamming the new uzi gun. If freejam really wants their fans and supporters back, they will actually makde the game balanced.

21882,Robocraft,2015.0,"UPDATED 24/11/18: Its been a while... and rc is still utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ That sums it up. If you're an old robocraft (2015) fan, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. Dont be fooled by recent reviews saying the tech tree is back etc. Its hardly like the older one. The Equivalent to T10 games are nothing like what they used to be. TDM is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ respawn fest with everything dumbed down and sped up. Theres no teamplay whatsover because respawns and self healing are a thing so medics are completely redundant. Absolute waste of your time if you decide is try this again.//Older review:Ask me for a review on this before Respawned and Overclocked update? (30/04/15) I would give this a positive review BUT AFTER Resspawned and Overclocked update....... That's a whole new side....Here's why-Before Respawned and Overclocked, this game inspired team work revolving heavy towards flanking, sticking as one big cluster of brute force because of the arena type mode. Once dead, you're gone. Once they introduced medics; it revolutionised the whole battle mechanic on whether a team would succeed or perish further reinforcing the team staying together. Moreover, when FJ released the team balance patch, the battles would last sooooo much longer and be even more adrenalin filled so you wouldn't be paired with 5 other rail walkers and be crushed by a whole team of smg tanks. As medic you would feel so valuable; one of my favourite memories...Megabots arrive. Some of the player base decides this was a bad move (this was where the game started to get controversial) however, in my opinion, this was even better because now the T10's would stick by the Mega's siding them in one big turf war. Those were the good days of RC.30th of April arrives. Respawned and Overclocked. The danger of dying now gone; stupid bots start appearing virtually killing the cleverly thought out designs using tri forcing ect. Team work is gone; no need to stick together. If you die, you can just respawn again. Don't even get me started on medics... Before Respawned and Overclocked, medics were the top priority on kill list. But now they're just replaced with respawn. Again, no fear of dying. Megabots are restricted to the old mode where hardly anyone played because of the shiny new Respawned and Overclocked. (The megabots were still fairly new yet all the work seemed to just be abandoned). Even though arena mode is still here, it feels as if it gets no love anymore.Robocraft Unleashed touches down. The removals of tiers and tech trees are here. This resulted in a huge backlash from the community as many veterans felt that all their progress was for nothing as it took ages to grind up to each tier and save up for new parts to find that it's no longer the case. In addition, going up a tier made us feel amazing and satisfied giving us a sense of progression. I can see FJ wanted to enable full creativity as many wanted but it just won't work.To some up-Robocraft used to be one of my favourite games and WAS a fun and enjoyable game. Simple and easy to learn. However, as the updates passed, Robocraft got more and more complicated destroying the fun and simple factors or the arena game mode into a supposed 'moba' style game...ps: if you read all of this; thanks for your time!",0

21884,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewHello, here is my review of my favourite game that became♥♥♥♥♥♥br>Im not english so im sorry for any mistakes i make in spelling in thsi review.I used to love this game back at the day, I played it every day.What was there back in the good old days? - tier system. If your bot was tier 2, you would face people in tier 2. If you could build a tier 3 bot, but builded a tier 2 bot, you can play against tier 2 bots again. Higher tier = more RP (currency in the game)  If you had premium (WHAT WAS OPTIONAL) you got double the income from everygame and gave other poeple +5% income. Not more- colours. Every tier had his own cube color (tier 9 purple, tier 10 black/red) Of you had tier 10 cubes you was the♥♥♥♥♥♥ because those cubes had the most lives. - Tier x. Back in the day there was a tier x (MAX tier) you could build a gigantic robot (about 3 times a tier 10 size) and battle against another tier x with tier 10 in your team. That was fun- healing. I loved to play healer in the game, everyone liked you because you helped them and it helped the tier x to stay alive.- tech tree. The tech tree was amazing, in tier one you could unlock tier one cubes, tier one guns etc. after every battle in tier one you got tier one unlock points that only unlocked tier one stuff. in tier 2 you got tier 2 unlock tokens etc. that was balanced.where did it go wrong? It started (i think) a year ago when they changed the tier system to idk what that was called. It was possible to make  a 0 to about 32k points bot and battle against the same amount of points robots. (nobody new why they did this) It was ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, the tier system was cool. I was tier 10 then. (The highest what you could be in battles without tierx) and after the update i was ""32K"".Some months later they changed the tech tree system. They removed unlock tokens, and made a spiral like tech tree that  unlocked automatic parts for what level you were. (no problem, you get the unlock tokens back in RP! What was like nothing) Still, the gameplay was fine and i was still playing it. What is wrong now a days?Problem number 1: They removed tier X (a lot of players quited the game) problem number 2: They made a new feature, auto healing! if you didnt shoot, or got shot, you healed back to full health. My favourite class was totaly useless. Why would you heal somebody if they healed themslefs....Problem number 3: first they removed every cube, everybody has the same cubes in the same colours that you can paint (antoher thing if you dont have premium, you only have 4 colours, if you pay, you have 9 more) This was stupid, tier 10 that was the cool black colour wasnt cool anymore because everyone that had premium could paint there bor black.Problem number 4: they removed the ♥♥♥♥ing shop! you cant buy cubes, guns, shields etc. anymore. NO, the only way to get new parts is by opening crates. Sounds fun! (thats what i tohught, because as a hearthstone player i like opening pack to get random stuff. But i was wrong. At this point the pay to win flew trough the ♥♥♥♥ing ceiling! In every box you got from team deathmatch you got 1 part. BUT if you had premium you got the other part to :) NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. So every match lasted about 5 - 10 minutes and you get one part, a part that you couldnt choose. The parts are ranked in rarity. The strong guns that you had in tier 10 became epics (very rare) and the old tierX are legendariesch now (IMPOSSIBLE to get if you dont pay. Do you want to buy a legendary? it is possible ig you sell al your other parts and maybe, just maybe you can buy a TO expensive gun. So if you have A LOT of money and are LUCKY you can get what? tier 10? no that doesnt excist anymore, max level? yes you could try to get max level but nobody can see it in a match. This game was so much fun and i hate it that it is so much♥♥♥♥♥♥at the moment. If i could change one thins to the game, it would be deleting EVERYTHING back to the tier systemDid i forgot to say that the game is unblanced at the moment? legendary guns are so powerfull. if you get one early on, you can destry a very strong bot that has played over 200 hours. even if your looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥and the one you shot looks amazing.♥♥♥♥ this game",0

21900,Robocraft,2018.0," I don't know how I'm supposed to start this review... Back in the days, Robocraft was my go-to Game and one of my favourite games. Robocraft has been such a great game I really loved playing.I don't exactly know why the developers decided to change up the whole game principle with Tiers (1, 2 and so on).In my last days back then the ""boss battle"" (I guess) was introduced and I enjoyed playing it as well.And then... the developers crashed the game with introducing Levels (?) instead of Tiers and changing the game mode from just stacking the whole team onto the other side and capturing the enemy's base to this weird thing with these ""Protonium Reactor"" (from Wikipedia lol).When I started the game today after a long time, I was greeted with my old account and 25 cases I had to open (~5mins uff).The game went a long way from Free2Play to Pay4Win with cases and add-ons for 108.96€.I searched for a match and had to wait for about a minute because I left the last match (a year or two ago?).[h2] Yeah, so what am I supposed to say in conclusion? [/h2]Back in the days I absolutely loved the game but in the current state I don't like it and I wouldn't invest my time into this game anymore.>50h (outside Steam)",0
21901,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI was a fairly casual player, get a couple matches in and tinker with my bots for a couple hours here and there. I was even considering spending some cash when able.The original system was near perfect, you could play free and feel rewarded when you played well. Each match (solo and PvP) rewarded RP, which was the game's primary currency. You could gain RP at fairly decent rates if you played well, up to 50k a match or more, and it was used to purchase new blocks for your robot. Premium wasn't much of a game changer, double currency gain and boosted exp, along with full use of the color wheel when painting your bot.Now, after the Epic Loot update, I am very glad none of my money went to Freejam. That accomplished feeling when performing well and helping your team towards victory? It is gone, for good by the looks of it.Now, you get RNG loot crates (if you're familiar with korean MMO's.. yep.. those, minus the keys) that have a tendency to give things you don't want or need, and the only way to get what you do want/need is to recycle the unwanted parts for Robits (new currency). The tier of crate awarded is determined by how well you played as a singular entity, team play nolonger matters as long as your side wins and you did the best. Losing team all get the same low tier crate, regardless of effort.You only get Robits from recycling. Recycling might give you anywhere between 10 and 200 Robits, depending on the part and rarity (they also added rarity tiers) while the part you want will cost 20k or more. On top of that, the loot crates withhold items from free players, displaying what they could have gotten, all they needed to do to recieve these withheld parts is purchase Premium.Premium is no longer just contributing to development with the perks of fancy colors, more money, and a bonus awarded to your team. Premium is now dangled infront of your face every time you open a crate, teasing you with parts that are decidedly better than what is currently being awarded. While still giving you far less than what you actually earned with your effortsSo, after updating and seeing what the ""new"" game has to offer. I have realized that even if I bought premium every month, I would not be able to progress towards my goals at a reasonable rate.Before this update rolled out, I was just a couple thousand RP away from buying a set of mid tier legs for my new mech styled bot. After I updated, I had 244 Robits and no cashshop currency, and no compensation for said cash shop currency because it wasn't above the 100 mark (You could earn cash shop currency ingame, previously). I tried a few matches, then tried a couple solo matches, after roughly 3 hours I had earned around 100 Robits. I needed over 120,000.To think, this update was partially aimed at people like me, according to Freejam. All it did was ruin my love for the game.(The free product checkbox on F2P titles amuses me)",0
21902,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFor some reason the devs thought that it was a good idea to put people with extreamly powerful bots against people who have almost nothing. They changed the currency. I once had 33,000 credits (or something like that), and now i have 1,000 green dust stuff.",0
21903,Robocraft,2014.0,"This game was great in 2014, and after the removal of megabots, things started going downhill from there. It has driven away veteran players because of its unplayable state. Bugs keep on getting added each update and they have yet to fix the Disconnect issue even after 2 years or to cope with it by adding a reconnect button in the first place. The game is driven towards mech now with each other movement type either forgotten about (skis) or good builds, getting nerfs. The arrival of the energy bar already made classic constant fire gameplay until one side messes up a thing of the past. Now its a turn based game with I run out of energy, now its your turn to shoot me. They've added and buffed autoaim weapons to cater to their target audience (10 yr olds) to the game now. They also added crates that you can buy at insanely high prices for a ""chance"" to win legendary items. The currency system has been nerfed with all the rich players having next to nothing and the poor players having nothing and continue to get nothing in the drops. If they really cared about gaining revenue and players, they would listen to the veterans who have been here the longest. Just because I have logged only 700+ hrs on steam doesnt mean I'm a noob. I played a year on standalone because of how bad the game ran on steam, which leads me to another point, they have different fixes for the launchers resulting in one update which buffed and corrected the steam launcher first so I came back to steam. Next thing is, with the ongoing changes, especially to the way damage is dealt and how weapons and movements work, they break your hard tested bots within the next patch. Building a practical build is now somewhat more annoying, although it does offer a challenge to always build the next meta. Some movement types have completely not received a buff or a nerf at all and FJ is constantly implementing new stuff instead of fixing up the old stuff or reworking it, if they couldnt handle it (like the megas) they simply removed it from the game and ended up removing a great chunk of building and players altogether. Furthermore, each update the game goes more downhill, moving further away from what it once was, RIP Robocraft May 2016",0
21904,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFreejam is just ignoring all the players they made the game a grind similar to warframe's grind but this game doesn't have enough content to make you want to sit through it you have to play over 100 matches to have half the money you need for a legendary which you'll either burn out from not having any new stuff to keep the game new like me, or you'll cash out with real money and finally buy it soon realizing it wasn't worth it at all cause then you want to have two because people just aim for your biggest gun. And don't think about having more than like two or three good robots to switch from at a time to try and keep the game fresh like I said you'll need to farm for another 50 matches to save up for the parts to that (not including weapons) and if you don't pay money by then you'll definately burn out and lose interest in the game like I did. So save yourself the hours before you no longer like this game by just not downloading not worth the residual space left on your hdd or sdd.",0

Congratulations! The cubes you’ve just spent >20k RP on now costs 10RP!Majority of original players: I just spent days of grinding in Robocraft and I now have spent hours to finally build my own megabot!Game Dev: Well you can’t use megabot anymore. Congratulations! Thousands of cubes and tons of time you have invested into it are now wasted!Majority of original players: Well at least I can still farm my RP and buy proper stuff in the store.Game Dev: You know what? We are introducing loot crate system so you can only earn back one-tenth of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff’s original value!

(proceeds masturbating with money which now replaces tissue)XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXThe game WAS great when there were boss battles (one high-tier robot vs many low-tier robots, for the newbies who can't play this anymore), tier system, megabots and ACTUAL CURRENCY. Then the game starts falling apart when some half-a** ed  think that tier-flattening on robocraft is good, and when they introduced epic l̶o̶o̶t̶  poop system. After you carried your whole team hard and scored the highest XP in every game, you get worthless♥♥♥♥♥♥for like 79 out of 80 games (despite earning the so-called protonium crate), while those that barely contributed to the team may earned a lengendary item from a silver or bronze crate. Even those who lose the game/worst  player in the game and only get a rusted crate can still earn a legendary item! This♥♥♥♥♥♥severely discourages people to improve and play well as the game barely rewards, or even punishes the skilled players with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crates.The matchmaking is also quite a joke. Instead of assigning a group of skilled players vs another group of skilled players to be more fair and equal, it is more likely that one or two elite players are put into a group of inexperienced noobs and newbies to ""balance"" a team, deliberately ruining the gameplay of those experienced players. In addition, the game does not consider the amount of flyers vs flaks when matchmaking, and so it is very common to see games where there are at least 4 flyers (or drones, to make things worse)♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a team with zero aeroflaks, or several aeroflaked robots being farmed by another all-grounded team.Speaking of drones, the introduction of camera control setting automatically make these space aids agile and operable by any 6-year old kids. And you know what? People don't really need skills to win anymore, as they just find another 3 to 4 guys to form a all drone party, and gg ez auto-win in battle arena in just 5 minutes, since the enemy team tends to give up trying once they saw these space aids ♥♥♥♥ing around. When you become one of those 5-man drone party, you don't even need to brag in the chatroom to show what a cancerous piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥you are. Isn't that wonderful? And the unforgiving server. As long as your internet is interrupted for just a second, it already disconnects you from the game. Instead of reconnect back to the game (which you can't), all you can do is waste another 5 minutes to get penalized for something you haven't done.Overall the game is essentially getting worse after every major-update, as it does not reward those that are good at the game, and the rate to earn in-game currency (r̶o̶b̶i̶t̶s poop-bits) is pathetically low nowadays.",0
21909,Robocraft,2016.0,"God damn, have the mighty have fallen. I had started this game around december of 2014, and it seemed interesting. The previous year came and gone without much issues with the updates... but then this year rolled around. And it looks like the game is under new manegement. I did not mind the removal of tech points, nor the addition of new weapons. But the straw that broke the camels back is one, important, thing. Nano disruptor's loss of damage output to enemies and therefore it's fall to complete uselessness. If you can heal yourself by just waiting, why have someone on your team with just nano disruptors when you can just hide somewhere and regenerate? The addition of lock-on weapons seemed like a good idea on paper, but it makes taking them on a nightmare when you consider that the new loot system has a good probability to reward these weapons. You should never, ever, EVER, have loot drops be the sole way to earn curancy and items. And more importantly, never have the RNG be too damn broad with the drops, as another reviewer has pointed out, it does not matter if you bought crates, odds are that all the drops will be comon or uncomon 90% of the time. I had to deal with Cryptarch Rahool in Destiny Year 1, and he was more fair with his drops even before Bungie fixed his rolls with engrams, than with this new BS Loot system. And what the hell is up with the ""Locked drops behind slots"" Deal? We got them out of those crates, give them to us, don't you dare shove a cupcake in our face and then take it away, because we don't have the neccecary requirements, considering these items are going to be hard as hell to get now, with the new currency situation. With the drop system in place, you have to break down items, just so then you can make new ones. Overall, Great ♥♥♥♥ing job with screwing over year long fans who enjoyed the game, and great job ♥♥♥♥ing over people who would gladly give you money with this backwater, money gouging system. You suck, because you made a once good game suck. Thank god for Jim Sterling.Update (1.0): Wow, you guys really ♥♥♥♥ed it up. I came back hoping that the game might, just might, have changed for the better, but no, it got worse. First of all, I see the loot box system hasn't changed, didn't even bother giving those who suffered through the last year of this♥♥♥♥♥♥show a day of prenium just to earn all of the rewards, no. And while I will admit giving players almost an unlimited size (just that in order to play pvp it has to be under 2000 cpu), the fact that getting blocks to build your bot with is still a chore makes it underwhelming. and is it just me, or is the weight of your bot is put on the back left as opposed to the center, where it should be? this can't be a counter to drones, as most bots are supposed to built from the center outwards, it would make no sense to change that. also, I miss the the single-player mode where you could kill bots and get rewarded for it. what, think that people were abusing it? It's actually laughable on how, at release, it has less players then when it went to alpha. then again it has been a year and a half since I wrote this review, and you've done buggered it up some more. Clearly yall are deaf to your audience, and you should be ashamed for it.",0

21921,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI have decided to rewrite my review completely to go over all of the current problems in more detail.I can see the game slowly fixing the balance issues and ""improving"" but it`s still not enough to make the game as good as it was before.First of all the new weapons :Proto seeker - nerfed garbageShotgun - no complaints, but it feels unnecessary and pointless because of all the powerful long range weapons. It can only be used in close range if you have an invisibility module.Mini shotgun - the same, but even more useless.LOML - aka where it all began, for those who don`t know its the original disbalanced weapon weapon update that everyone was outraged by. The weapon itself is idiotic because it takes no more than 3 simple steps to use this weapon : 1. aim 2. wait 3. left click.Aeroflak - probably the only weapon that isn`t bad, but it still ruins lifes of many flying bots.However the problem that ruined the game are not the weapons, but the EPIC LOOT update.Before you could play cassualy (about 2-3 hours a day) and collect enough to buy a loml in 2 days now it takes more than a week of grinding.Crates are supposed to be something that you CAN purchase not a main way of receiving cash.I don`t want my cash income to be randomized. Some say that it`s good because you can get premium items without having to pay for GC, but I haven`t seen a single person who prefers cosmetics over gameplay. Also why should I grind for something if it`s unrewarding, random and boring. The feeling of progress is gone and is replaced by grinding and crates.There are also major score problems, but maybe I don`t entirely understand how the new system works. Before it was simple - who dealt most damage gets first place. Now people who do almost nothing can get first place for no apparent reason.New interface is not that bad, but please add an edit bot button in the preview section.Inventory forge cost is incredibly bad. For example you built a 100k bot and you expect to get something for it, you see that you have 10 purchases, but where is the cash ? It`s simple everybody uses inventory forge cost and you end up receiving absolutely nothing. Just make so that if somebody inventory forges your bot you receive at least a 1/4 of the bots price, you receive only a half of a full purchase anyway.Also 500 cpu bot battles are just lomls a aeroflaks being pedofiles.I nearly forgot about new modules :Invisibility - I don`t even know what to say about this one, it`s only used by shotguns and flying bots.Shield - aka the least used item in the game, easy fix would be to make the shied move with bot.Booster - aka how to make 1200 cpu bots better than 1500 cpu bots that don't have a module.",0

21928,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewSo there's a mini ion disruptor and there's also going to be mini flak....What's next? Mini blocks for mini d*** builds?In all seriousness though, it used to be good. I used to spend hours into this game, trying to make an good build. Heck, I even voted for it on IndieDB in 2014. I should have never done that.Anyways, listen to this song when you read the reviews :3https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we2kmO24rgE&index=7&list=PLIe0MpdLjMlK8h17QZGsx58oiBaebQR4e( I know the song doesn't fit too well, but it should be sufficient ) ",0
21929,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI need to get this rant out first, then I'll talk what I like and disliked.I played this game like crazy.  I won't type out all that I loved about the Old Robocraft. As I won't put a deep feeling of nostalgia to me, and of Hardcore fans.So, here it is......Robocraft is dead to me now.  It has lost ALL OF IT'S appeal to me.  A year or so ago, I played this non-stop.  I enjoyed it to the point where I would wake up 5 in the morning just to play this.Now?  HAH.  No.  They put a !@#$ing crate system in this game.  WTH.  I don't want that !@#$ in ANY game!  And they also screw with the physics to the point where VTOLs are no longer possible.  WHY!  WHY FREEJAM!  GET RID OF THOSE AND PUT BACK THE LEVEL SYSTEM!Ok.  Now that I got that out of the way, I'll tell you what I adored about this game.2014, I saw this in my recommended games.  Looked at it, read the description, and what I saw was that they put Minecraft, and robots, together.  That description did no justice to the game those precious years ago.You would have somewhat incredibly intense games in the higher tiers, trust me in this, before they threw out the leveling system it was adrenaline inducing.  Three years later,  ""Hey guys!  We decided to f@#$ up the game even more by adding crates!""Why........ just.....why.........  We early Hardcore Robocraft fans understand where I am coming from....  It really makes me sad to see this game RIPPED away from me!  I am torn between giving this a jab in the face, or 100+ hours.  Meaning: I really, really, really, really want to give this game a thumbs up, but now, I... Just can't.  They messed things up when A lot of us hardcore fans said ""NO!  Please don't mess with it like that!""  When a friend told me that there isn't really a tier thing, meaning that any level can play any level, and that ANY level can use ANY itm, tore me.IN LOVING MEMORY,       The Old Robocraft. (2014-2016-ish years)                 Freejam, if you guys read this, change it back!  It was much better then!  Honestly, it was a lot better with tier separation and level requirements.   Please put the level CPU back!  I can't give this game a thumbs up now.  I'm sorry. ",0
21930,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewWhy would Free-Jam do this. Tne game was at it's peak a coiple years back and then they added the crate system that made me quit as it was no longer the game it was and not very good. I came back 2-3 weeks ago and have suprisingly enjoyed the game. (Still prefered the older version) However; the BETA is the biggest pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥I could imagine. What was wrong with the game? Why do you keep changing the core mechanics? The first time round all my vehicles became useless and this time the same has happened. This game used to be my favourite and was becoming it recently. But Free-Jam if you do not sort out your game, I will unfortunately not be playing. I only wish for you to look at what people have said. Yes I see you talk to the community often and how you act on feedback, but from what I see in the game. You don't. I you will be able to see what is wrong with the game. If it is just me, sorry for the rant. For me I will not have robocraft installed on my PC. Goodbye Free-Jam, I hope to play this, what once was a great game, again.",0
21931,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI might not get the timeline right, haven't played in a whileI am also a pure f2p in robocraft.This game used to be epitome of a well balanced f2p game to me. I hope Freejam makes the game like that again.I've been on and off lately, but I've accumulated most of my hours before the dissappointing updates the developers brought us. This game used to be my favorite only because of the game mechanics of creating robots and fighting with them. I had many hours of fun playing well balanced battles with a great community. I wasn't particularly good at the game, but I still loved it. Then I left the game for almost a year, and when I came back, I was confused about the new system of weapons(tier flatenning), but I was fine with it, as long as the game is still fun and NOT P2W. I was around lvl80 out of 100 at that time, and I was saving up for a megabot, the badass giant that gets all the medics. THEN THEY REMOVED IT. WOW DEVS, GREAT. Now I grinded with my trusty little smg tank to go to wt used to be around tier 8-9. Soon they started rapidly adding new weapons and systems, which I didn't enjoy mostly because of balancing. Once I reached lvl100, they added the loot crate system, which was really ""the final nail in the coffin""-Rosefall. He was the most subscribed youtuber who makes vids for this game, and has left the game because of these updates... Moment of silence plz. I decided to stick with the game because I saved up quite a bit of RP. One thing I did enjoy at that time was that normal bots can have TX-1 parts, and having them doesn't bind you to only mega parts. Soon I built a very powerful smg tank with mega plates and T-10 plates. Having a hefty amount of RP was the only reason I stayed in the game. I played many battles and to be honest, I was quite happy about the gameplay because I had a good bot. After achieving lvl 120, I decided that was enough. A lot of robocraft players like to edit their bots when they get something new, and I did that for every level that I achieved (you gain 10 CPU every level before 100 and 5 CPU for every level after 100). Soon I reached some very high tiered battles, and that's when I realized the balancing with normal bots with special weapons/equipment(minigun, shotgun, telemport...) and mega weapons (Mega plasmas/ Mega smg). Since these equipments costs an obsurd amount of RP and have somewhere around a 1-3% chance of dropping in the most expensive crates, few people have it. That's where the developers got money hungry. People who would buy premium acounts and all that will have better equipment, and those special equipment they get really unbalance the game. I was constantly in games with enemies using mega smgs and mega plasmas that can take down my t10 shield in one hit, ONE HIT. Wtf. I was pissd off, but I kept playing because I felt the game was still solid, but after weeks of grinding without success for anything good. I said that's it and I left the game. I still loved the basic concept of the game, but the money-hungry developers ruined the game. A few days ago, I downloaded the game again because I wanted to see how the game is going and if there are improvements, and I felt betrayed by the fact that the best robot I've ever built that I've used for hours cannot be used in battle because of CPU restrictions. W tF It fit the restrictions perfectly before. i dont know what update they made and I didn't want to know, and I uninstalled.Overall, I feel like this game had great potential, but making a great game apparently wasn't the developers's goal. This game is definitely still worth a try if you didn't know how much better the game was before the updates, but I just can't stand the nonsense the devs put into this game. I hope the devs realize what they have done to such a great f2p game and and do something about it. THIS WAS MY OPINIONS ON THE GAME, IT'S F2P SO YOU WON'T BE LOSING MUCH IF YOU TRY IT.",0
21932,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFirst off, I would like to say it has been absolute ages since I have played this game. And when I used to play the most (during 2014). I only managed to get a couple of months of playtime before the first bad update, that had made people start leaving. That was the update that got rid of tiers. I only came back to check up on it and see if it had improved any, and hoooooooooooooo boy, that was the worst mistake I have ever made in my entire life.First thing is first, this ""game"" looks nothing at all like it used to. To even say that this is the same game as the Robocraft people used to play is an absoulute insult. The current ""Robocraft"", is so different from the way it used to be, it might as well be an entirely different game altogether. And truth be told, the way it currently plays, it practically is! With the lootboxes, and market, and just the way the game plays with all these new weapons, nothing is the same as how it used to be. That is for the game that is.Now I don't know if any of the older players have checked out the official robocraft website recently, but there is one big change that gives off a huge red flag. The ability to comment on any of their posts is no longer available. Why is this? I honestly have no idea. But if anything, it speaks loud and clear, that the devs want nothing to do with interacting with the fanbase. If they even have one anymore, that is.They have started putting polls on their website though. These polls are supposed to let them know what the fanbase wants the most. But of course, with it being a poll the options are limited as to what you can pick. However there is usually a little part at the end that lets you write any improvements that may not have been listed. All I can say is that if we realy want the true Robocraft back, to use this section of the poll to the fullest extent. Especially since they do not seem to be listening to the people writing reviews about their game. I have already taken said poll myself, and have written about some things that may need improvement.In the end though, all I can realy say to freejam, is that you seem to have forgotten why you won the Indie 2014 awards. You won it because the fans voted for your game (myself included), becaue it was really well made! To say that you deserve such an award now would be an absoulute lie, because a large number of your fans have not supported your current desicions and have been leaving. And that is the only reason, you even got that award in the first place. Because people loved you. Now however......",0

21946,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis last update is terrible. It is completly backwards from what a game like this should be. There is no progression and the loot system is terrible. There the economy is broken horribly and not it is impossible to afford to make nice high-level robots. It doesn't matter how many games you play, or even if you do better than everyone else, you'll still get loseless parts that are worth nothing. Because of this system the lower ranked matches are just as vaible to loot as higher matches so there are tons of high-level players destroying all competition at the lower ranks. This makes it very tuff for new players to ever upgrade and improve their robot. Freejam is terribly greedy and are obviously made the drop system to dope young players into spending money on these cases that are often full of worthless items. Do not support these guys. This is not good game design and they do not deserve any of your money or time in the game.

Game doesn't require premium to play however you are gonna need it to minimize the moutain of grinding that awaits and thats with premium so imagine this game without it.2. Devs still haven't fixed bugs that have been in the game for a long time and they don't seem like they are going to.3. The only way to get the parts you want are to either get exceptionally lucky and get it in a crate (and your gonna need more than one most likely so good luck getting more this way) or grind more than you would in a mmo for crates that you then will take what you get out of them and deconstruct them for the bare mininum of points till you can finally get the part you want.....then do it a bunch more times cause you'll only get 1.4. A lot of the weapons are unbalanced they are either to weak to be viable or so strong that they will be almost all you will see in combat.Now currently the dev team says a rework of the crate system is coming......I don't know if it will actually make things better (i doubt it, this current system is a money hungry and I doubt they will completely fix that) but if you are considering playing this game I'd atleast wait till then.

Weapons are unbalenced - there is a new rocket thing that I call the noob cannon, because it is too easy to get killed by one, dying is too easy in general, espect to die at least 10 times a match, there is no normal mode like there used to be and games are REALLY unfair now, say a team is winning and they have captured all the points, it makes it even harder because then their base shields go down and the winners go up, so if you start losing, you probably will.These are just some of the problems with this game.If you are a brand new player wanting to try out some newgames then go for it, but if you have either played the game before all the thousands of updates or if you are looking for a casual yet fun game that plays well, looks good and gets you motivated to get out of bed then I suggest you get a time machine and go back a few years...Seriously, look at the negative reviews, they are almost all from players with 100+ hours, they know how good it used to be.",0
21953,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewReturned to Robocraft after a year to find many changes - many of which initially excited me, but then after a number of games realized that balance of weapons is still sorely lacking. I read how the developers want to move to a ""horizontal progression"" scheme, and while I agree with this move in theory, in practice it still amounts to a grind to attain what are currently the ""best"" weapons.Previously, the game had a kind of rock/paper/scissors balance between different types of bots, but they recently changed it so that you can use multiple types of weapons on a single bot. In theory, this should be exciting, but there were many balances that had been calibrated by the previous 2 years of development that were trampled on by this change. Despite the developer saying that they wanted to balance weapons, making even lower quality weapons effective depending on player design, in practice they are not.Matches now are dominated by users with long range missiles and close range shotguns, both of which cost an arm and  leg in terms of play time to acquire. Every other weapon is of such reduced value that most of my previous builds were rendered virtually ineffective. Despite having played over 200 hours of this game in the past, acquisition of the new weapons looks to be very tedious - too tedious to hold my interest in returning to the game. ",0

They've gone to exceedingly long lengths to make this game balanced, and if any player out there gets into this game early, know this: all that fun you're having in the low tiers?

21960,Robocraft,2015.0,"XXXXXX PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW XXXXXXXI have to agree with the majority of the reviews - this WAS a great game, I had put close to 250 hours into this because of the old levelling system which actually gave you a sense of accomplishment. The last updates have completely ruined this game an I have no interest in playing nor promoting this terrible failure of what was once great. Sorry devs you really did us all an injustice. Don't waste your time.****Update*****ROBOCRAFT STILL SUCKS!After attempting to get back into the game so many times, having read all the promises from the dev's about how fantastic they have made it, it still sucks hairy nuts. If they would rewind the clock back two years when this game was fun and enjoyable, if they would get with the program and listen to the community - out of touch devs have ruined a once awesome game. Not to mention the rorrible server wait times and being penalised for dropouts (leaving early when the server just loses contact) I just hate it now, and I am not alone.****Another Update****I have gone from hating it back to playing it... But not in love with it like I was before in BETA days.Yeah yeah I know, I said it sucks, which in comparison to what it was originally - Yes it sucks. But coming back into it with the perspective of, what else is there like it to play? Tell me please?I want to build and fight, I want to refine my bots and make them better and more punishing, I still get rewarded for playing- not how I used to be rewarded, no sense of accomplishment now but I still get crate drops every round so there's that. Small consolation to what used to be an ""EPIC"" or ""LGENDARY"" game. I put down another 250 Hours and am enjoying it, I would prefer the old OG Robocraft but that's never gonna happen, so I will continue to play regardless. Other things to point out about my current standing on the game.I have just recently at the 480 hour point decided to show my appreciation to the devs and buy Premium for life.I am not one to buy into Pay To Win scenarios and I have never bought any P2W bots but the benefits of buying P4L was both appealing to me as a show of dev support (still not happy they changed the game so much from the original versions) I have an extensive library of bots now, all built by me. There is a certain level of toxicity from the community, I see criticism against people with cool bots or if the team isn't cohesive and you try to voice yourself sometimes other players on your team will just diss you, even when you are actually ahead of them in points. There are a lot of idiots playing this game but all in all I have decided it it worth my time.Is it worth your time too? I can't answer that but I think you need to give it a chance and decide for yourself.",0
21961,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewCame back from a long hiatus and the game design has changed so drastically that I no longer endorse this game. They had the perfect formula for progression and building strategy, but now it's nowhere near the tier it used to be on. (TL;DR alert) I've decided to update my review a little further to elaborate on why I don't play anymore. I used to enjoy logging in to play a few casual matches, get some tokens, and have a feeling of progression - but it's kind of lost on me now. The removal of tech tokens changed the 'skill tree' like aspect of natural progression, but the actual gameplay itself is what killed my love for the game.Originally, the pilot seat was the 'vip' so to say when you were designing a machine. All of the other blocks had to be skillfully placed to prevent the source block under the seat from being destroyed, and also from becoming detached from the rest of the blocks (if a single block connecting a mass of blocks to the pilot seat was destroyed, the mass of blocks was destroyed too). Exploiting this in matches was the most rewarding thing in the game - some robots could withstand volleys of fire with only cosmetic damage, but there were also those with obvious weak spots. Shooting said weak spots and watching 75% of their machine disappear was the highlight of playing a rail gun, or any other weapon for that matter. It was the highlight of the game. The second most rewarding part of this was playing the executioner afterwards; you drive along looking for the remnants of their bot (usually a wheel or two and a pilot seat) to deliver the final blow.How did this change? The removal of pilot seats and the addition of an 'auto heal' mechanic for downed robots. This absolutely DESTROYED the enjoyment of the game for me. I regularly ended matches with my gunbed functioning at below 15% health, and this was due to having 3 working wheels and a gun left as a result of proper building around the mechanics of how damage was done. Not having any healing reinforced the importance of actually building properly and also the importance for players to have medic bots. The poorly built plasma bombers can no longer be punished - a shot to the weak spot will not destroy 75% of their robot, and in the off chance you ground them they will just automatically heal back up and continue flying. Completely ignoring the pay to win mechanics and other atrocities that have come in to the game as well, the gameplay itself is sufficient to never play this game again. It used to reward building skill, strategy, and accuracy but now it mostly reinforces mediocrity. I got destroyed all the time when I first started playing, but I did research and learned how to make good machines which eventually allowed me to make variations that would give me usually about 6 kills per game (no respawns when I played)I honestly don't even mind freemium models much, but I HATE when devs destroy a game which perfectly filled it's own niche.

21962,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game is great in single player.Great vehicles, good for creativity.However,The matchmaking queue sucks, me & my friends waited for an hour and we haven't even been able to play, the queue numbers kept going up and down.",1
21963,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewWas one of the best games I've ever played but the development team has lost all semblance of touch with it's playerbase.While it once offered challenging and interesting gameplay and construction it now has been modified to remove any skill or tactics from the combat and construction. Where people once spent countless hours fine tuning creative vehicles now the most effective bot is a brick with several guns attached on treads. Additionally they have enstilled extreme limitations on all tiers making gameplay homogeneous and boring at all levels.At the begining of the year I couldn't have said enough good about this game but now all I can say is don't waste your time. Look up Steamcraft if you want something more to the tune of what this game used to be about (be warned though the whole game is set up in russian so there is a bit of a learning curve).Update: The limitations on tiers have been lifted by way of removing tiers. Now the old problem of extremely powerful weapons making it into low level games is worse than ever. In an attempt to fix the problem of overtiering they have made it much worse.Additionally the lead developer made a statement that he will be much more active on the forums, bringing up new ideas and getting the communities feedback before adding in unwanted changes. And he did...for 3 days. Since then (roughly two weeks ago) he has been all but completely absent on the forums. It appears that nothing will convince the devs to really use community feedback.",0

21966,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe core concept is still original and fun however ... I would agree with nearly every negative review that has been posted recently.The new Epic Loot patch has seen the cost of the game skyrocket. A month's premium access now costs nearly as much as a full price monthly subscription to a full scale MMO (consider the fact this is supposed to be an 'early release game') plus the new in-game loot system gives randomized  blocks with an extremely poor 'recycle rate' worth approx 10% of the cost to forge new pieces. It will now take a very, very long time for new players to accumulate enough parts to build anything. Or a lot of cash and good luck with the random crates.Despite having played 100's of hours on this game - until there is some major overhaul or rollback on the incredibly expensive pay-to-win  / random loot model Freejam has put in place I would not recommend it.",0
21967,Robocraft,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter reading some of the negative comments, I must say it's not as bad as they paint it...The game's about building vehicles like they were lego's and putting guns on them and pin your creation against other peoples creations. It's fun! Satisfaction comes from seeing your creation bust up the creation of other people as you shoot them. At the end of the match, you return to your mothership to make repairs and/or changes to your ship before the next match. Repair costs increase the higher level you are, but you usually earn more than what you loose in repairs. At higher tiers it does start digging into your pockets, but it creates an environment where careful strategy against the enemy becomes the main focus, and not some rambo crazy kamikaze attack because you'll literally end up paying for mistakes with credits you can use to otherwise upgrade your ship.Sure, there are ""premium"" users, but that's not a huge deal... all they get are blocks that you can also get with some game-time. They still have to level up to use enough of them because of the ""CPU"" Point system, so it's not exactly Pay2Win (Because, I must emphasize that you can get what they can the more you play)My favorite part about this game is the physics engine. You can't just make any vehicle work out, so it's funny seeing people at spawn flip over onto their backs or flying ships going haywire because they can't get good weight distribution. Overall, it's a great game to pick up, play for a bit and then do something else. You won't regret it.Oh, did I mention it's a free download? ... yeah ;)Review Update#12/10/2015The game just keeps getting better and betterRepair costs are gone and new parts just keep flowing in!Optimizations are fantastic and with each Update comes a fresh breath of air that spices things up!",1

21971,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access Reviewim not the type of person who has poured upwards of 1000+ hours in, but i have spent a good 500-650. so take this with a grain of salt i guess.i think the worst part of RC is the fact that now you can put whatever weapons you want to go with your bot. the whole point of a team based game in which you can pick different classes (or build diff robots) is to pick a playstyle you like, and when that playstyle can't work in a situation, someone else on your team with a different class (robot) who was built for that situation can support you. in otherwords, teamwork. now, although cpu limits prevent people from having very heavy SMG/other weapon tanks, you can still be a plasma/rail/medic walker/flyer, fufilling multiple roles at once. even if said bot doesnt excel at any offensive or movement capabilities it has, it's still NOT something that should exist in a teamplay class based game. robots like that sound like something a child comes up with who bends the rules of a game so they win every time. it's also worth noting about the removal of the pilot seat. it did have a weird damage absorbing mechanic (which nobody bothered to edit), and ejector seats are also kind of annoying. but they gave bots a design aspect in which damage had to be redirected away from it as well as the bot being connected somehow.there's also the repair on kill feature. conquest would be quite fun and more team based without, due to the fact that nano guns and medics exist. passive repairing, and repairing on kill ruins any need of medics and therefor team support that robocraft once had. next is how low the rewards for beating a match have gotten. even past the battle arena update with the new gamemode, the rewards were still good enough that you could build a new robot after a few weeks if you were that dedicated to the game. nowadays you barley get anything out of winning a match, and it could take you forever just to get one of the top-tier weapons such as shotguns and missiles.speaking of which, those weapons look cool and seem fun to use. unfortunately, they're reserved for those who are willing to put up with the grind to be able to buy them. why there isn't even just ONE down-tier version for each of the weapons is a mystery. and if it isn't, its probably a stupid reason.luckily crates are a thing, but due to how long it takes to get a weapon and how much money you need for crates, it seems like more of a cheap way of making money. sure it's not p2p, but with weapons taking around a couple of weeks to accumulate, it seems like fj is trying to force players to give them money. there's also the removal of the tech tree (or its still their but the weird gui makes it hidden), which wasnt even a tree after maybe conquest? the whole point of a TECH TREE is to unlock components that you want for your specific playstyle and bot design. a TECH SPIRAL does not give this freedom, and forces you down a set pathway that results in the stuff that you want taking longer to obtain. to make matters worse, the low rewards mean that you HAVE to rely on random crates. RANDOM CRATES. don't go and actually try and design something, and buy the parts yourself. just let the game give you stuff and you have to try and figure out how to combine that stuff. great choice.speaking of cheap money, it makes NO SENSE that the ability to color our bots with a wide spectrum, something that people have always wanted (but due to tiered armor being tiered you couldn't really have an artbot in any tier game), is very restricted. they don't even let you buy them once with gc and keep them forever. it just seems like another way of getting cheap money, but it isn't even that well hidden.lastly. despite all of this, FREEJAM HASN'T DONE JACK. i know there are a whole bunch of people who say that ""FJ just has a bit of a listening problem with the community, i'm sure we can send them a clear message somehow."" now i hate to shatter your dreams, but this is the exact same thing people have said A YEAR or even TWO years ago. now ill have to admit that i've never had too much of a problem with RC back then. i am by no means a ""true veteran,"" but i have been around before tank treads and after walkers (?) and stayed up until the pit and conquest were restricted. even back then, there were complaints. not great ones, and not too many serious ones. but they were generally about the same thing and even then, FJ probably hasnt read or responded to most. i can only recall 3 things that FJ has ever changed after listening to the community, one of which was weapon damage increases for everything except smgs for balancing, and the rest probably bug fixing. I COULD BE COMPLETELY WRONG SO DONT TAKE MY WORD. and before someone tells me or anyone that ""indie game compaines are small and need money and time quit yapping uwu,"" freejam has grown from 5 members to around 20-30 in the megabot/conquest update and now they have 40. some bugs have taken a few months to be fixed, despite them being more than an annoyance and posted on the forums atleast 2-3 times a week. which is inexcusable. and i understand that FJ as a bigger indie game company needs more money in order to continue development as well as give devs money for at home stuff. but even then, they could just do this by expanding the previous concepts that made the game excellent, as well as adding more content such as the top tier weapons in a balanced way in order to draw in new players and devs, more money, and speed up development. instead they have watered down the class system in the game in order to appeal to a new audience, who will probably get bored after a while. over time more and more people are going to leave until there's less people playing RC than there are on battleborn.making an indie game requires extreme dedication to your ideas and community, and feedback+quality must be put before money and more players. FJ has demonstrated that they clearly do not care about feedback or quality. dont download.tl;dr the denseness of freejam, the watered down importance of bot design, the poorly disguised money making tactics, the long grind, and refusal to listen to feedback, is going to drive FJ's ""new audience,"" and any othere ""new audience"" that they attempt to aim for every few months, until there's barely anyone left.

21981,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewWall of Text inbound:Great game. Amazing game. I love this game to pieces.  At least I used to. The game was awesome up until recently. Than crates arrived. Actually I shouldn't blame one update I suppose. If I were to pinpoint the starting point for this disappointment, I'd have to point my finger at the introduction of the CRF. This feature, which I'd like to say was nice in concept, intensified an already present issue within Robocraft and set in motion a domino effect that more or less led to the train wreck we have before us today. The CRF allowed for the rapid deployment of ""OP"" bots or rather exploitative builds. I'm going to use the ""tesseract"" as an example. While not a huge issue on its own, it is the way FreeJam went about ""resolving"" this issue that made matters worse. To any ""veteran"" of the game that had some knowledge of the problem,  the simplest and least devastating fix would have been to nerf corner slope health to the point where use as armor would be ineffective. A more ""complex"" fix would have been to fix the exploit that allowed the construction of the buil'ds armor. Sadly, FreeJam did not choose these options and instead decided to add not 1,but 3 (now 2, but still) weapons designed to deal with these builds. While the build was successful in their intended task, they also took the rest of the games aerial population down with it. This isn't a review whining about badly balanced AA though, so onto the next nail. Shortly after this fiasco, FJ introduced ""Epic Loot"". A system widely revered as the complete opposite of its namesake. Alongside ripping out a system that was working just fine and was much simpler to balance, they supplemented this change with a system that could be best described as gambling in a system where the house wins 9 times out of 10. Instead of a system where players could either work for or pay for a specific item they desire, they are now forced to ""test their luck"" with crates. Crates that logically fail to reward a player. Common sense dictates that higher tier crates should award better loot. This makes sense. The crates FJ has forced upon us do not follow such logic. High tier crates rarely reward suitable loot, in fact it would appear, from my experience, that low to mid their crates are more likely to reward a player's efforts. This is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, period. There's also the complaint regarding the premium row ""flaunting"" items, however this hasn't really annoyed me as much as others. Moving on to the big one. A lack of communication between the community and the developers can and will be this game's downfall. If every problem listed before this were grouped tighter and weighted as a whole, they wouldn't come close to overtaking this issue. As simple as this problem is, it is so bad in FJ's case.  The simple action of posting plans for balance changes or suggestions on the games dedicated forums is so foreign to those in charge, that someone looking in from the outside, would likely see it as nothing more than a place for  angry customers to vent. Why? No devs will respond, with exception of Drognin, but it's his job as community manager (and we love him for it :3). The devs that have a proper power over the games development use Twitter instead of their own forums. It's dumb. Anyway, as if this wasn't long enough, I'll quickly list the pros and cons of the game. So Tl;Dr:Pros:1. Builders may be entertained if they get good stuff. 2. Not pay to win because buying crates just means you get more crap. Cons:1. Devs are usually silent, unless they're being praised 2. Balance weapons? What are those? 3. Exploit/meta builds everywhere. Creativity doessn't seem to be a major concern to FJ. 4. Hope you enjoy gambling. ======================I really like this game. But sadly, I can't recommend it to anyone because for 1. You're not rewarded for♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the devs don't seem to intent on fixing the issues.",0

21983,Robocraft,2017.0,"I played both the original robocraft and the one currently available on steam. The original one had and Experience progress system where you unlock different weapons and lbocks with exp you earn, after which you could buy these blocks with creddits you would earn or with money. During the building of your bot your tier level would increase, which would influance which opponents would roughly be searched for to go up against. Battle were fought somewhere between 10 v 10 or 12 vs 12, but could be randomized (like 6 vs 9) depending on how strong the bots were. Battle was fought world of tanks style. One life, one enemy base, one friendly base, and go.New version has different battle modes, of which the main mode is a conquest based map with 3 different points to capture, and respawn enabled. There is no Exp system, and no tier system. you have a maximum of 2000 points to use, that's it. Blocks can be bought, with points (slowly earned or recycled for with parts you own.. don't know the numbers but seems like 20% or so of it's original worth) or with money. they can also be earned with... our all time favorite ..... lootboxes. Now, the reason i came back to the new steam version was because i remember Really enjoying the old verison. And to be fair, although i would rather battle multiple enemies at once and retry next round, the new battle mode is still fun, going around with bots. Building is still the same (appart from the tiering stuf), and it's fun to build. However, what put me off was the ridiculous amount off ..... I would describe it as ""Rubbing it in"" that you are not currently a paying customer.Some examples:When recycling your unwanted parts for dust points it blinks on screen that you would get 4 times as much dust if you were premium.When opening lootboxes, which you do get at a fair rate (1-2-3 a match), you open 8 blocks, weapons, etc. off those, you receive the bottom 4, the top four are closed off with a neat sign saying Unlock with premium.I would say i am resistent in buying these things and only spend money when i am certain the developers deserve it, more as a donation then actually buying the stuff presented. But this game forces me to evaluate if i should not spend my money on there every 10 minutes.In short, Fun game, went in the wrong direction, still fun but not worth the trouble if you don't intend to get premmium.",0

Old Review Robocraft has, to say the least, run through some bumpy updates, whether it be including RNG into the game's system (as in making you rummage through multiple loot boxes to get parts that are generally useless to someone higher than a new player), or completely remove tiers [(a system which helped balance matchmaking of bots so you wouldn't get massive bots shredding into new players like wet paper)Robocraft's gamemodes go as far as this-TDM, your general gamemode in almost every combat orientated game-BA, Battle arena, a mode about capturing points to mine protonium crystals to power a weapon that destroys the enemy base-Brawl, a mode that is either free-for-all or TDM that has some gimmicks to it-Custom Games, a customizable game where you invite people in to play a game you customized- AI TDM, TDM but with robits controlling digital robits-BA Ranked (or Leauge), BA but for every loss you lose MMR (a value which is used to rank you in the gamemode) and for every victory you get MMR Mechanics and stuff The Forgethis is basically the shop where you make things using robits, the ingame currencymost things are pretty expensive and require atleast more than one game to getRecyclingYou scrap parts you get from loot boxes (gained from playing games) for robitsInventorythe menu where you can see what parts you haveBuildingyou build bots and stuff, health blocks (basic cubes) give a hp boost to everything, light cubes are 3x the CPU cost (the value which determines how costly your bot is) and are more durable but give a 3x less boost in hp compared to cpu.Misc notes about stuff:-parts recycle for alot less than what they cost-loot boxes have robits in them-loot box items in general are rare or below for even the best loot box, though the best one mostly has large sums of robits (mostly yeilding atleast one 4,000 and sometimes a 20,000) Gameplay most of the time it's either you die or dont when encountering enemies, from my personal experience, after winning alot you'll experience a loss streak. Alot of bots above 1000 CPU contain larger weapons that will kill you unless you have a better bottldr; game isnt that great but isnt completely unplayable, you can find some enjoyment after you get your first large weapon (excluding the protoseeker)  EDIT:  They've added robits into crates, giving somewhat of a chance to progress without mindlessly spending hours on said game, my opinion of this is still a do-not-reccomend, but it has softened.Edit2.  From what ive seen so far with the updates, Freejam has improved in how they update, although this game is flawed to say the least, it's not unbearable now.",0
21990,Robocraft,2016.0,"They kept killing it by changing the core mechanics.They basically added paywalls to the point that progressing is really boring if you don't throw a lot of real money to it, to the point that the game currency is almost useless (the last time I played it they changed it to some sort of ""dust"" lmao) and swapped normal rewards for lootboxes...These crates give you 4 items (8 with premium) and you don't get money by even winning the match, you have to recycle the items for in-game currency, but is not satisfying either because it's like 10/100 of the price in the shop while a premium user already has x3 times more stuff than you by that timeAlso, only premium get the rare stuff from the rare crate (yeah, rare quality stuff appears). Too bad you didn't payed for the rigged ""random"" cheap rewards.Matchmaking is broken as hell, there's people with an endgame weapon attached to a low tier leg just to get on low elos so they can progress faster.You can get every weapon too quickly with money, it kills the point on dedication.Medics are useless, they heal too slow, dependant and can't really deal a lot of damage...Don't even make me talk about the megas, there was an extra final tier called ""TX"" where people had ""mega"" robots and stuff like that, they removed it completely.Just don't play it, don't give them money, they don't care about the community, the in-game currency and the matchmaking. The reddit page and forum of this game was a complete mess as they kept adding weird changes, many people got banned because freejam doesn't like getting criticized.",0

21994,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewDear Freejam.Robocraft Was a Great Enjoyable Game. something great to come back to after a long, tiring day, to let loose. Yet then that all changed.The Epic loot update, unlike it names sugests, made it the worse game known to man, within a couple of hours.It made me cry, for a few hours, to see my what was favorite game become this inslut. In the time i have layed down this game, to presure my other dreams and try out the other games that have been collecting dust due to my love for this game and when i picked it up again. It Became terible. The Epic loot update, Which happened in my absense unlike it names sugests, made it the worse game known to man, within a couple of hours.It made me cry, for a few hours, to see my what was favorite game become this inslut. The old Robo-Ranking or even messed up tier matching system, was better than this junk. Now they use cpu for matching. This is the main reason it sucks, robocraft wouldn't be this bad and this could of been a posstive rating if this wasn't a mechinic.Now the removal of the tech tree was too, a terrible idea.  this allowed Op things to exsist in lower matches which is another reason this game now sucks.they also changed the loot system, and the ecomny. By this i mean they Set EVERYONES BALNCE TO ZERO. geting rid of all the hard work grinding RP. Thanks! RP used to be the reward for playing matches. they changed this to crates. which depending on how good they were. Even from the best one you rarely get anything good.When i looked at these mechinics, i noticed something, These mechinics did not allow Free to Play to be fun at all.However, They made Pay to Play Awesome.You could get anything you wanted not only because everything is exepseive, but also the removal of the tech treePreuim also got 2x the amount of stuff from crates, Xp, and 2 more paltoon spots.I miss the old robotcraft, with RP, GC, Tech Tokens, without the overpowered almost unachiveble cubes. But the thing i miss the most was how fun it was. Back when they had good ideas for updates. I miss when there were tiers.Please for the Love of god, fix your game Freejam. Look at your recent ratings.Sencerely,Your Old FanPS.

21995,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewUsed to be a good game, now Freejam just wants money. At first (or at least the first time i played it) it was a fun experiece of grinding and thinking, ""i shoukd be in tier 6 by now."" They updated it, took away the tier system, and added a new ""points"" system. this was pretty easy to deal with, as you still could buy items from the in-game store. next, the multiple weapons update, this took away the specialized comabat roles of individual bots, not to metion auto-heal which turned robocraft into ""shoot as much as you can then get behind cover"" as opppose to ""plan with your team or die."" then came the worst update, the epic loot, you can no longer buy items from the store, you can only get them by paying for crates, or playing enough to get the items you need. this completly ruins the purpose of bot design as you cannot buy new items, you can only wait for that weapon the you were saving up for before the update. mabye someday Freejam will listen to thier playerbase, mabye someday they will become less hungry for our wallets, until then, may we remember robocraft.",0
21996,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe game used to be good. Trust me, you don't want to play. I've been keeping up with the patchnotes and some other stuff relating to it, only because I'm too lazy to unfollow them on Facebook. The patches seem to be following the pattern I saw in the days leading up to my departure from the playerbase about a year ago. I've noticed their desperate attempts to add band-aid ""features"" and ""balances"" that are meant to appease their ""fans"" and keep them around and have them pay 2 win. The DLCs aren't worth their cost at all, $35 dollars for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ flyer that won't last 5 seconds in a match? LMAO!! and $50 for premium? WTF?!?!? At most its worth $10! AT MOST!I've sunk so many hours into this game because, once upon a time, it was a good game. And then they slipped on the stairs and fell down into the depths of Hell itself. How? idk. Supposedly, at some point, Freejam was in major debt to its parent company, and so they introduced the crate system as a way to convice players to buy crates and premium in order to pay off their parent company. Since they are still around, it seems like that worked, even though it shouldn't have. The crate system is literally a festering cancer, as they add new items (that are cancer to use) the reward pool grows, decreasing your chances of getting anything decent. Then again, the drop rates were rigged in a way that very rarely did something decent drop, and it was most likely in the premium row of items, so you needed to be feeding them money in order to get it. Premium was never worth the price. In the early days, all it did was double your currency income, which meant that you could sealclub all the newbies. As a newbie back then, I can say that sealclubbing was a very common occurence, it took me 6 months thanks to that to actually get to the mid tiers. After a while, they added colors so that you could color your bots however you wanted. And of course, there was a catch, you needed premium to get more than 3 colors; white, an ugly sky blue, and an ugly off orange. And after crates, you needed premium to get decent items, or in most cases, more items to sell, at what felt like pawnshops, to save up your pennies for that badass weapon that is the current meta. But thanks to the pawnshop-like selling, it would take you literally years to save up enough to get 1 of that item, let alone the 3 or 4 you'd need for it to be viable. And by that time, the devs would have initiated at least 4000 different metas. In the early days, everything was relatively balanced. Of course there were ways to exploit it, but it wasn't that bad. After a while, the game became extremely unbalanced (addition of new movement types and/or weapons). So, they did some quick patches to ""fix that."" R.I.P. balance, that set the game into a death spiral of cancerous metas. While that may sound bad on paper, its far worse in reality; worse than a plane spiraling to the ground while its tail section and one of its wings fall silently beside it. There were the over-tiered tanks, tanks built with low-tier armour and equipped with guns from many tiers above the armour (possible because of the way your bot's tier was determined). So, slap some tier 2 armor on, then slap some tier 7 guns on, go rek the tier 4 people, ggez. But tiers were removed, so good bye over-tiering. Then came the flak cannons, RIP flyers of all kinds. Then came rockets, RIP everything. Then came the hovers with the tiny corner triangles (I forget what they were actually called), which zipped around in the sky being invisible and obliterating everything. Then came the ultra tanky mechs, absorb all the damage, and destroy everything. Then came the shotguns. Then came the tiny, cloaked, tesla (melee basically) bots. After that I left, no surprise really. I'm sure there's been even more cancerous metas since I left too, sad thing is, there's probably more than I think (which is saying something, cause I think its a ♥♥♥♥ ton). There's always been building restrictions, you have never been able to build what you want. Its sad really, because there's so much potential in the concept. You want to know the saddest part of the entire popularity of this game? Even THE most popular Robocraft Youtuber, Rosefall, left because he got fed up with how much the game had drifted from its good 'ole days. Rosefall has moved on to bigger and better things, you can search up his channel if you want to see what happened for yourself. Really the only remaining popular Robocraft Youtubers are Gromek999 and Jac733. I can only assume that they are paid by Freejam to continue making videos that shed a positive light on this game, I don't know how anyone could make a positive video on Robocraft anymore, even if they were paid. They could pay me $10mil a video and I still would refuse to brainwash the uneducated young into wasting their lives and their parents' money on such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. In conclusion, don't waste a single second on this game. But even more importantly, don't spend a single penny on this game, Freejam doesn't deserve your money.",0
21997,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game was great, once.Until the developers ruined it. This is my opinion for 3 reasons.1. The Tech TreeRobocraft used to be so much fun when the Tech Tree was there. It gave the game a purpose, something to aim for, to       unlock better gear. Since that us now gone the game has no purpose, it has become Minecraft 2 where you can just build whatever you like.2. The Tier SystemAll the original players would agree that Robocraft was better with the Tier System. It made the game fair for everyone and made it so you could get matched with Robots the appropriate level to yours. The Tier System and The Tech Tree were what made the game great as you had to play games, earn tech points, unlock new gear and keep doing this until you could get your Robot to the next Tier.3. GameplayIn the Respawn and Overclocked update the gameplay changed dramatically both negatively and positively. It made it some once you were dead you were still in the game but this damaged certain things. For me this update made the medic useless. Instead of the idea of the medic helping fallen team mates and stopping team mates getting eliminated they altered it so if you were damaged you could just respawn. I know they kept the normal gamemode but no one played it. Recently to help with the creation of this game becoming Minecraft 2 they have made it so your Robot no longer requires a pilot seat. This is stupid in so many ways and now the Rail Cannon has become somewhat useless. It used to be that if you headshotted a Robots pilot they were instantly destroyed and still is. This means that people who don't have pilot seats have a huge advantage. Overall Robocraft has been completely destroyed and made unenjoyable.P.S. I used to play the game through the launcher not through Steam so don't think I'm just some noob with 8.9 hours.",0

22000,Robocraft,2015.0,Early Access ReviewHoly crap you need 30M+ to play a non-deathmatch game. By the time you get there you will be so board of playing this grinder. What happened to the tier system?! What idiot came up with this new system thinking it was better?,0
22001,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewMy how far this game has fallen.I've been into this game since pretty damn near the beginning. Back then it was a sense of adventure to rank up through the tiers and levels, both of which were very hard to increase - so the challenge was there. That sense of ""Yeah, I built that"" when you finally make that perfect bot was also brilliant.Those days are long since past.The tiering system is gone entirely, and it is SO EASY to level up, that when I started the game after it was first changed. I jumped from 55 to 100 instantly, and I heard you could jump from even further back than that. The game's menus are SO CLUNKY now and they're hard to navigate... I still don't know what many of my button mappings actually do on the menu, but they do something. The colouring system was a neat idea - though it's just a consolation prize for losing the tiering system - but you have to be premium to actually have creativity with the colours, which is just... marvelous. Oh, no more tech points? There goes the fun in unlocking things too.The Community Robot Factory, while well-intended, is just a plagiarism facility at worst, and at best utterly annihilates that thrill of finally completing a robot which you built yourself. Also, HOW MUCH ARE THESE WEAPONS?! TEN MILLION RP FOR A SINGLE TOP-POWER WEAPON? GET STUFFED I AIN'T PAYIN' THAT I ONLY GET LIKE 50-100K PER BATTLE!!!Medic bots have been rendered obsolete, as has any form of stategy in the game and the building, by the auto heal feature. If you do actually take damage, you can hide behind a corner, and get all your health back. What a load of♥♥♥♥♥♥ And the pilot seat was removed, so no need to worry about protecting the weak spot now.I really miss the old boss battle/megabot challenge. Couple of strong bots against a full team of weak ones. That was actually really fun and it was balanced too. Guess they decided it gave the veteran players too much enjoyment, and they didn't want noobs rage-quitting after one of these fights, so it's gone now.Worst of all, the game crashes a LOT more than it used to, which really pisses me off, as if you're in the middle of a battle, SEE YA NO REWARD FOR YOU WE JUST WANNA WASTE YOUR TIME BYE! I swear the amount of times I heard ""A PLAYER HAS DISCONNECTED"" in one match was frightening, just before I crashed myself.I remember the days when I used to enjoy this game, but now it's both too complex and too simple at once. Complex, in the sense that all those CUBE VARIATIONS; inner slope, edge slope, what? WHAT ARE THESE FOR?At least they refunded all those new garage payments I made so now I have thousands upon thousands of free GC. So there's that at least.UPDATE TIME:So, they changed the mechanics again, by changing prices so they are a bit cheaper. Fine, that's alright, it's a good start. What isn't so good is that they lowered the maximum reward whilst raising the minimum one, so now you earn roughly the same amount of RP whether you're complete crap or absolutely amazing. To quote, ""Our intent was to help boost the RP income of below-average skilled players so they felt they could make progress regardless, and to lower the bonus obtained for doing exceptionally well to something far more reasonable.""So now what? Now there is ZERO incentive to actually put effort in to get good at the game, because you still get a decent amount of RP just for participation. This just downright insults those who have taken the time to learn and master the game by restricting the value of their skill, and patronizes the weak and makes it so that they don't have to actually master the game at all. Add this factor to the appalling matchmaking and you get a complete and utter mess of a competitive game.... If you do exceptionally well at something, you expect to be rewarded for it. If you're bad, you're deprived of that reward so you have incentive to get better so you will EARN that reward. But no, everyone gets similar amounts now. It's as if the devs wanted to be modern-day Robin Hoods, or those feminists trying to sort out the mythical ""wage-gap"" that no-one can prove exists. There's a better way to fix the progression issue; stop making everything so goddamn expensive. Even with these price drops, most of the top-tier weapons are seven million or so anyway - so what's the point of all this?Well, at least they tried. They killed off all of their veterans with this change, but they tried. I know some of you will call this ""nitpicking"" but when you see how much of a stupid concept this all is...UPDATE AGAIN:Ok. They reverted the reward changes. I take back all that I said before. Good to see that the devs are actually listening to the community for once. Let's see where the future takes the game now. They still have a bit to fix.",0
22002,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewI had a chance to play Robocraft a lot earlier on, and it was a good title. Now, to use a strangely-appropriate vehicle metaphor, it's pretty much a mess of parts.Very little of the game really fits together. Every other month, Freejam adds a new part or rebalances the old ones, with the effect of making one particular build empirically better than all the others. Notable sufferers are fixed-wing aircraft, which are rendered totally obsolete by the nearly-as-fast, tougher, more versatile, cheaper and nastier helicopter blades.These are balance issues which are never likely to be fixed either, seeing as Freejam's chief concern of late seems to be the eradication of any challenge to the vehicle construction - anything goes these days. Personally, I can live without seeing movie characters romping around in my battlefield. I came to fight a war, not Minions.And sadly, it's infested with gamebreaking bugs, ranging from one glitch which switches your robot's collision detection off, allowing it to phase through the ground - all the way to the one which simply overloads your RAM and crashes the game at the end of every round. I wish I could recommend it, but I can't. Robocraft just isn't very good at being Robocraft any more.",0
22003,Robocraft,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewA thumb up for this game.Yea i know this game have a lot of bugs but its normal, it's a pre alpha.Why i give a thumb up ?Because this game get very often a great update. Freejam (the Dev's) are very often on the forum and read our wishes/bugs/off topics and robot creations.This is not a matter of course. But they do this, and I like this!Okey back to the game:Pro's:-  many updates-  for creativ user is this game a good choise-  The Developers (FreeJam) are very often on the forums- The fights are short (you can play this when ever you want)- The weapons are really balanced- If the servers down freejam are so nice and give Promotion Codes.

22004,Robocraft,2018.0,"Where to start?So, i've been playing since alpha and the one thing that has a been a steady constant through-out this game's gradual release is that they have ""NO"" constants what-so-ever. Now don't get me wrong i fell in love with this game, and had sooooo many fun hours and have met some amazing people who i still talk to even though i don't play much anymore.So why have i given it a negative?10v10 or 7v7 - now only 5v5Map Shrinks - Try avoid that drone now lolMegabots - Simply removedDrones.....DRONES!!!Old Style medic guns had a dmg use and took skill to aim - now auto aim only and no secondary dmg ability.Tech trees of old - Nothing at all now (although they are putting this back in i hear, another old idea they are going back to AFTER the release of the game /facepalm)CPU/weapon energy being important - In the past this system has come and gone multiple times.Tiers (ie. a place for seal clubbing) was a BAD idea when it was first implemented, was thankfully removed - This is coming back soon....really? REALLY GUYS??? new players won't stay long.They jumped right on the loot crate wagon and have since been trying to back out of the whole idea with their tail between their legs. SHAME! (again they are reverting back to the old system, sense a pattern yet?)Meta Bots - (ie the top robot for very high MMR matches) isn't it balanced you ask? Not in the slightest, Drones have dominated the top tier for well over 2 years now (they have varied in design but the fundamentals have always stayed the same) They are too quick at turning, they can take more damage than something that size should be able too, a team of 5 drones all with backup medic guns (remember these just auto aim) will make any well organised group quit if they aren't willing to buy this said ""meta"" bot of the crf.My final point is about the Community Robot Factory (CRF) -  This simply killed the game off. No longer do you need to understand the mechanics of the game, simply type ""drone"" or ""meta"" into search engine and hey-presto you have a top tier robot. The game seemed split after the release of the CRF of people who could build and those who couldn't. So to close, i would love so much to recommend this to you but i can't, i used to joke that robocraft is 1 game but feels like i've played 10 different games over the years.

22011,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewRobocraft used to be a very good game.Used to be.Now it is a slow running pile of garbage, with extremely unbalanced guns, repeatedly changing game modes, a major Pay2Win aspect, and it crashes constantly.During playing, I've repeatedly experienced crashing whilst building (removing all of my progress) and a failed connection which was not my fault, yet still gives me a ban.CPU Costs are majorly underrated, the rocket launcher and ion based weapons are extremely powerful, whilst you're lucky to get 4000 damage in a match with the second best laser cannons, and Plasma got even worse.Bugs are constant, Modules are overpowered, and the game only gets fun, and you only get a good ship, if you invest money, thousands of hours, OR are lucky enough to have gotten the alienware promotion (like me).I started this game with the pilot and tech tree, and it's going to end here, with protonium crates giving 1000 robits, 1 per match if topscoring, so you have to win 150 matches to get a module.It is incredibly hard to advance whatsoever in normal mode, starting players get a huge boost of which is unbalanced to old players, and this game is quite frankly trash.",0
22012,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewWell, I'm sorry to say that the developers have managed to wreck what was one of my favorite games. 1. The new battle mode is lame. I am not interested in blasting cubes off of towers. I want to engage enemy bots. Yes, I know that is still ""part"" of the game, but is should be the only part. I think it would work much better to simply have zone control based on sole occupation of areas (similar to world of tanks). Also having too many modes has caused crazy long que times. What used to take 5 - 20 seconds to join a match, now can take 15 minutes.2. The developers have decided that components that are higher tier should not be placed on lower tier bots. This has essentially ruined all my bot designs and makes the game (bot design and game play) very cookie cutter. It doesn't balance game play as much as it creates identical builds due to fewer options.I will NOT be back to ROBOCRAFT. Way to turn victory into FAIL. ",0
22013,Robocraft,2015.0,Early Access Reviewi love this game soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much but exept the glitchs (we will get to that later!) so ehm... yeh great game i loved the Hallowfest the garage was soooooo cool all the changing paintings and pumkins LOVE IT ALL!!! can't wait till the Xmas update,1
22014,Robocraft,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game is super fun. You have a plethora or blocks, guns, wheels, turbines, etc to build your own robot any way you like.I just noticed there was an update (that plane looks awesome, going to install again and check it out!)The only bad part so far is the limited maps. Seems to be about 2 different kinds of levels (desert and snow) with I think 2-4 differnt maps for each - gets boring fast.Also, one bad thing is that people will abuse the higher level guns and build a minimalist vehicle with one higher power gun and just sit back and wreck everyone, so that gets a bit frustrating.Highly relies on team work.Would recommend. This game can only get better, and it's free!Edit: After making it to tier 10 after 100 hours in the game, it's pretty much lost it's fun.I am level 54 or so, so my CPU is limited to 1015. There are people with lvl 100 in tier 10, which can have much more stuff on their robot, which is a huge advantage.I am no longer interested in the game as it's only going to be repetetive from here on out. I will just get recked by higher level players and I'm not going to put myself through that.Goodbye, robo craft, it was fun while it lasted.Second edit:They added mega bots.

22025,Robocraft,2014.0,"Early Access Review! ! ! UPDATE ! ! !Will revise review when EAC stops blocking Test Mode and unsigned drivers. Would be positive otherwise.----------------------------------Take a game with a good concept and throw in every con known to mankind, and you have RoboCraft, the game you want to love but want to strangle to death at any given time. Robocraft wants to be a good game that can allow players from around the world make their own tanks/planes/mechs/flying pinwheels and pit them against everyone else's, except that it fails on every part on what a good multiplayer experience should have and soon becomes boring, repetitive, and rage inducing.In Robocraft, you can make just about anything you want to a degree (but more on that later). You have many options of movement from wheels that let you tread around the terrain to hoverblades that let you cushion some air between you and the hard ground. Advanced players can arm themselves with wings and take to the skies or mix everything together into some monstrosity that were not meant for the eyes of mere mortals. From the start, you get 3 robots to work with and 3 garages for each one. Each also demonstrates the unique weapons of the game: the sub machine gun, the plasma cannon, and the railgun.Let's talk about the weapons: the sub machine gun is you standard 'SMG'; high fire rate, decent accuracy, and good effective range. They are the only weapon (at this time) to have two varieties: front mounted and top mounted, with front mounted being able to lay on the face of a cube and top mounted being best for being on top of a cube. The plasma cannon is an arcing explosion-on-hit weapon that requires some skill to use, but once mastered, it can easily be one of the better weapons in the game. It is only trumped by the railgun, which might as well be the 'point and kill' weapon. The SMG and plasma gun do not have block penetrating damage (though the plasma has splash damage), whereas the railgun does. While it's balancing factor is that it takes 20 seconds to reload, this creates a problem because of how the game determines 'death.'In your design of a mech (robot, mech, at this point, the game doesn't really seem to define what on earth you are building), you have a pilot seat, which is where your pilot sits. For a game called 'Robocraft', this seems out of place, and in gameplay, it is. It is a 'block' that consists of 2 blocks outwards and 3 blocks in height. It must rest on two blocks underneath and those two blocks are your only lifeline. Let me repeat: TWO BLOCKS DEFINE IF YOU ARE ALIVE OR DEAD. Remember the railgun's penetration ability? It didn't get the nickname 'point and kill' sitting around drinking on a summer beach (the plasma cannon is no better). Your dream robot better have a huge underbelly because that is your only way to survive, but even then that only gives you a slightly better chance at not dying.So let's talk about gameplay. At the moment, there is only one game mode: Capture the point. A team wins by sitting on their enemy's base until the timer gods are satisfied with your demonstration of doing nothing or you can kill the enemy team in your quest for showing off your mad Plasma cannon skills. This is all assuming you survive the first 5 seconds of the match. The game's physics engine is your first real enemy: assuming there is at least one impatient person on your team (pro tip: there always will be one), you may run into the situation that just a gentle bump will send your Robotic death machine into a flying whirl that can only be achieved in a cartoon. If you land right side up, proceed to call that teammate a moron and move on. If you don't, congratulations: you are now target practice for the enemy railgunners and plasma cannon users until either they kill you (and your two blocks too), or the match ends. You can quit the game at this point with the penalty of taking 25% damage (more on that later).Assuming you survive the onslaught called 'Lack of Teamwork', the network engine will come out to play. 'Warping', or when an entity moves from place to place due to network latency, is common and the same happens with their bullets. This can make SMGs get magical penetrating powers and make enemies appear to attempt a re-run at flipping you over like the impatient teammate whose mech looked like a fried egg. This doesn't have a lot but when it does happen, you can join the therapy party for everyone else who died from the same reason, and that party is at least a third of the player base.So about damage in the game. The game's definition of 'damage' is the total health of your mech, which is mostly attributed by what blocks you used, since each one's armor value is different depending on which ones you do use. If a set of blocks becomes disconnected, that is considered to be doing a massive amount of damage and your health will plummet like most of your hopes and dreams of what could be achieved in the game. Any damage you receive at the end of a match (including if one of the two blocks providing your pilot leg room gets destroyed) must be repaired at the cost of either the in-game currency or actual money. Remember that 25% that you lose if you quit the game early? That also falls under your bill and if you get flipped over after taking damage, the 25% is only tacked on to what you have. This makes any earnings you received from the game get minimized even further. The game has a 'bonus engine', but the rules for that are to laugh at any player trying to actually achieve it: you must not die and your team must win. This means if your team wins but you were sacrificed to ensure victory, congratulations: you haven't appeased the Robocraftian gods enough for a pay raise. Will that be cash or cash?Surely there has to be a way to keep the game balanced, and the game's attempt at it is laughable at best. There are 10 tiers, with each tier under the assumption that the weapons and armor of that tier is better. Unfortunately, this isn't the real world situation. You can be shoved into a higher tier due to using more blocks for your beach ball of doom or because of the weapon's lethality. On top of that, assuming you have evenly matched lethality and good looks, the matchmaking will often pit you against tiers 1 to 2 above your own. Suddenly those pair of sunglasses you added aren't looking so hot and floorless pilot is you with the enemy team's highest tier mech mowing your fellow team's tier mechs for target practice.The icing on the cake is the map selection, and unlike the flavor selection at your Dairy Queen, you have only 4 to choose from, two being ice and the other being on Mars. If you have the misfortune to be rocking out with tires on the ice area, have fun on the ice river that each ice map offers, as it has a physical property where you will glide forever in one direction despite how much you try to turn and reverse the other way. You will grow thankful for how other games interprets ice physics after experiencing Robocraft's interpretation. Mars doesn't really have much going for it and the blandness will make you wish for another map, all of which are chosen randomly while matchmaking, which is the only option you have (no picking a match, no choosing an enemy platoon to face).In closing, Robocraft is the game that wants to be unique and enjoyable, but falls flat on its face on its own ice physics only shortly after tripping over its own flaws. I haven't even covered its 'premium membership' and other obvious ploys to earn money quickly and with as little effort as possible, but those would only add insult to injury. Give Robocraft a try for an hour, but turn away and don't come back afterwards. At least until they get their act together and actually try listening to what little of a community they have.",0

22028,Robocraft,2018.0,"been playing this game since early 2016. i'll agree it was a lot more fun then, but it's still decent now, and the principle is still mostly intact :). I would love to see:+ older map styles (bigger spaces so fights aren't so stationary) + protonium towers as opposed to pointholding/destruction of protonium as opposed to growth + larger player number for BA/LA. + better matchmakinggreat to have the tech tree back and the condensation of RP into robits is nice too. the biggest gripe i have with this game is the graphic design... the transition animations/rendering on certain objects look too tacky. when i first played, RC had that really relaxed, clean ""open source"" feeling, especially when i would just build robots in the garage for fun. now i feel like the graphics are... too shiny? as if they're going for that OW/Fnite feel, which is kind of awkward???? but that's a personal aesthetic opinion... and it doesn't affect gameplay at all. :-palso, right now the weapon meta is kind of weird, but given the constant nerfs and buffs in this game i hope it gets sorted out. it's not enough to make me not want to play this game either lol. TLDR: Robocraft right now is worth at least downloading. It's decent. I hope they add more old stuff and reevaluate the balance between good graphics and good game mechanics. It's like, 95% possible to enjoy this game without paying anything if you go in with an open mind. :) ",1

Mabe jam (the original creator) or whoever is in charge is fed lies that it is an succes or he isn't even paying attention and he demands his game developers to bring in money and he changes things after his own stupid wish, just like EA did with SWBF2.

22031,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe last major update really dumbed down the game, before you would have to really put some thinking into parts purchase, get better armor cubes? or shields? or guns? one had to play  with th diferent cubes armor rating in order to protect the vital parts of the robot (besides other things). Now if you just make a bot with a bunch of blocks and strap a bunch of guns and you can survive for ages! Before one could get one shot kill with bombers or  railguns if hit the right robot spot, Now it takes forever to destroy pretty much anyone because everyone uses the same blocks. Block type is one variable removed that helped to make the game challenging.A bad remark also for the non-compensation on blocks when the update was made, some of us have spent a lot on blocks and that was a waste of time and money for some. I'm glad i didn't spent any money on this game otherwise I would lose the investment in blocks. I don't recomend to spend money on this game because you can lose your items overnight in some crazy update or your item can be rendered useless by an updateAnother one is the pilot seat removal, it helps to create diferent shapes of robots, but now you don't have to protect your sweet spot! again, making the game easier by removing the sweet spot and the limitations the pilot seat had.The worst one is the auto healing, this completly changed the game dynamics! before you had to think on how to build your robot even for the case it would get damaged, making sacrificial parts to be blown when under attack. Also you had to put some extra locomotion parts, in case you would lose wings, wheels, etc. when under attack. Now you have auto healing! no need for this! just hover your bot over a mountain, if someone shoots you down, just lay on there hidden (when possible) and wait to be up and running again! Same for tanks, just hide in a corner when your health is getting low.Before the update you would think twice before engaging, now everyone is Kamikaze! before you could damage an airplane or tank useless with a couple of shots, so people would be carefull when atacking, now everyone just charges ahead full steam! Also untill the introduction of the AA canon, the game was quite unbalanced, air units had a massive advantage because of the hit and run tatic, T10 block and the auto regen.Only good remark was the introduction of colours.Al said, I think the game was dumbed down in order to attract more people and to please fustrated users who couldn't do a good robot or use them properly.  The developers want to please everyone and attract more people  making the game  more ""arcadish""  but they are scaring some fans away and killing the thing that made the game special, I know I don't play as much asI used to!It was a very good and addictive game now I guess it's just ok, something to fill that 10 min break.PS: sorry for any misspeling, no spell check was used.",0

22042,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access Review:o( I used to highly recomend this game. Now with the new loot system, loss of a tech tree, and lack of block teir. There is really no reason to play it. If you play it for an while you will get everything you need or want. Or you can just pay for it. Sadly it looks like the money men won out with this game. They got rid of all the good stuff so little kids can just hop on and get everything they want, or  buy what they want. If you want a game that will challenge you to build a machine that took time, effort, and game knowledge. Your looking at the wrong game now. This has gone over to the kiddy freemium side. It was a great game that made you want to work to unlock better guns, wheels, and armor. Now you can just get the best items in the game if you do well in a match. I left after the huge bot update that had everyone hidding behind the big bot in the front because it got really boring like COD got. You just shot back and forth until you killed the medic bots behind the huge bot. So I left and now when I come back hoping to find that they evened things out and maybe added a few more game modes. I sadly find a great game has been gutted inorder to make more money. It kind of seems like the game manager went on vacation leaving the money men and the scripters to go nuts. While there are some new funish macanics there is now a lack of any restrictions. want a sniper,medic,aa bot sure why not kids have fun. We used to have to carefully craft our machines for a role like defender, attacker, wall, tank you name it. We had to come up with a solution on how to fill that roll. We only had so many bots to make before they charged us for it. Making us carfully construct our machines. Now you get as many slots as you want and can go bot happy. While I do like that they use a workshop allowing you to use other poeple's bot designs as long as you have the stuff for it. That is a small plus in all of the new negative aspects of this game.",0
22043,Robocraft,2016.0,"Would not recommend after Epic Loot update. ""Economy is better"" said the devs... after converting my existing RP very unfairly and making it so I really couldn't buy anything. Also, one of the main ways of gaining currency involves premium now. So, unless you have real money to spend on this, you're only going to be getting half of the currency that you should be. Incredibly unbalanced matchmaking after this update as well.I've been here since before Plasmas and Rails were even a thing, to see the game treated like this is just such a letdown. Unless there is an update that can address a few of these issues, I can't recommend this game in the slightest.(This game can be known now with the alternate title: ""RoboStrike: Global Offensive"")",0
22044,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access Review(I KNOW THAT MY REVEW MAY SUCK AND HAVE NO SENSE, BUT WHATEVER)I've played this since there were tiers in this game. I've enjoyed it so much then,but now...These new updates literally destroyed the game. EVERY. SINGLE. UPDATE.First, they removed tiers and added rankings; then they added megabots; then they removed tier blocks, research points(forgot their name) and megabots and added PREMIUM COLORS, LIKE WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?!? Then...this update, with CSGO crates and they removed premium currency...WHY?!? and now you can buy premium items, which is like why the ♥♥♥♥.the currency is now gained ONLY from disenchanting. You gain resources from crates that you get at every end of the battle. You get only junk from the crates and, well...disenchanting what u get will give tou really little dust. So, R.I.P new players.So, now this game is Hearthstone combined with World of Tanks.Also, the ranking is gone and now level 1 people, with level 1 SMG's and lvl 1 plasma launchers can meet shotgun, grenade launcher and all those ♥♥♥♥♥.So, this game is now really REALLY bad. New players will have no chance in this game and pro players will just leave the game because of how bad this game has become.So, R.I.P Robocraft. Beginning was awsome, now a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I really hope that the old updates could somehow come back...",0
22045,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI would love to give Robocraft a good rating but I just can't. If you had asked me to write a review two years ago I would've made it quite positive but as of right now the way you get items and just how monitized the game is forces me to make this a negative review.Pros:Fun to create robotsSeeing what random stuff your friends decide to make with their partsCons:How obnoxious it is to get the items for your robotHow monitized the game is becomingBalance isnt always thereThe crate system is annoyingThe curret system for getting items is really annoying. You can spend upwards of 5 hours playing matches which arent always balanced to get crates which normally have garbage in them so that you can sell the items for miniscule ammounts of money just to get that one walker leg or electroplate. As it is right now if you want to actually get any items in robocraft it basically forces you to spend a ton of money opening cases so that you can sell the items to make your robot.Then there is premium, this is really annoying. Without premium you have to spend even more time playing games to get cases to get items because with it you get double the items, good right? No. You still get the garbage items you normally get but just twice as many. Also in the past it would help other people out in the match if you were to spend premium and now it doesn't at all. Why? Because freejam wants everybody to spend over $9000 to get a half decent robot. Then there are platoons, normally you have 3 people in them but if you have that fourth friend who wants to play too bad, spend money and your problem is solved! Yay... premium is good if you plan on playing every single day but otherwise save your money and don't spend any money on it.",0

Then the game went to where you unlocked things in a certain order. Drop this game for about a year and come back to a game where levels mean nothing and everything is achieved through loot crates. That and there used to be different tiers of robots, this would keep things balanced so people wouldn't put the strongest weapons on unless they wanted to be matched with similar strength robots. Removal of this feature means players like me with all of 20 hours in the game that have mid grade weapons get matched with people with 1000 hours in the game who have some of the highest grade weapons.

FJ still doesnt know jack about balance",0
22055,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis should be a good game, and by all rights it is. The gameplay is fun and the robot design mode usually works properly but there a few major problems worth mention.There are a number of methods to get under the map and once there its a simple matter to wipe out the enemy team. EVERY ice map has somewhere to get underneath and its extremely frustrating to get destroyed and have the kill cam show the cheater sitting under the game on a huge sheet of ice that streaches the entire map.The simple fix for this would be a kill-zone that streaches underneath, insureing that when a cheater manages to get underground it would destroy them and respawn. On a plus side I've only seen this on the ice maps.Some game modes have come and gone, and while they were kind of nifty the game has changed to be more focused in thier absence. However what was unacceptable was the removal of Megabots. The game has Microtrasactions, and to support the game I was having fun playing I purchased multiple Megabots with US Dollars. A recent patch removed the Megabots and gave NOTHING back.The replaced 'Power Booster' does nothing (Well, ok full energy recharge takes 8 seconds instead of 10 seconds but you'd never notice unless you took it to the test zone with a stop watch) so its not in any way helpful. The mega weapons take FAR too many flops to be placed on a regular bot since if you do it'll take 600/1515 PFLOPS and then you still need a method of movement and chassis.I requested a refund for the 10 mega guns and 4 wheels and 3 hovers I bought with USD. After spending $40+ worth of GC they returned... $2.50. Unacceptable. They let you return the mega parts back for the full RP (Nonpremium currency) but you can't return them for GC and all of the cool vanity items are GC only. I submitted a ticket about it, but I'm not sure if it was anwsered because I have no idea where thier anwser would GO for me to read it. I don't even want the money back I just want my GC, and I think its reasonable that if I bought them with GC I should get refunded GC.TL/DROdd glitches in Robot Builder, a number of cheaters, and be careful what you spend you money on but otherwise awsome game with active devs. Worth playing but don't spend money in here until those issues are fixed.",0
22056,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewYou'll see a lot of opinions of this game.  The fanboys who will support whatever the developers do, and explain to you that that Freejam is doing everyone a service by allowing this game to be free.  You have the new players who probably think this could be a great game, if they worked on a few things (things that have existed in the past, and have since been done away with).  You then have the old players, the ones who put a lot of effort to get that last bit of RP to get the next piece of hardware, to hopefully lift you to the next tier.  Those players have seen this game turn into a phone app that says ""FREE"" next to it and then right underneath ""in game purchases optional""...but we all know that you need to purchase those if you don't want to be miserable for a while.  I'm one of those players, and this is my first Steam review of a game, because I think what's happened to this game is unfortunate.  It's a shame that all the feedback, all the bug reports we have compiled, have led to this latest update.",0
22057,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewRobocraft WAS a great, fun, and rewarding game until yesterday.  The in-game economy is completely ruined now, and you will never be able to build the bot you want to with this ""Epic Loot"" update - that is unless you like bots with one wing, a mech leg, and a couple tier 1 smg's that looks like utter garbage.  Because that is what you get: utter garbage to build with.  Before, you could play a match, do well, and get rewarded accordingly.  Now you play matches and regardless of how you do, you get worthless piles of nothing that you can sell for even less.  Random winnings is NOT a good idea for this game.

22060,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAs stated by ~MagmaBlast2000 \""Now for my review. I made it negative, because even though I really do like the game, I hate all of the new updates. They make the game worse with every one of them. They added Flak, LOML, and worst of all the Proto Seeker (all three of which are weapons that need no skill at all, since two of them are lock on and the flak has a huge explosion radius). They removed Megabots. And lastly, they added crates and removed RP (which makes it nearly impossible to get the parts that you need).Robocraft used to be a great game, but now it\'s ruined.\""I completely agree with this, the removal of megabots is possibly one of the most rediculous things Freejam could have done, It is stating, in my opinion, \""♥♥♥♥ the players who farmed for hours to get ingame currency to buy endgame gear which took many hard working, stressful hours and instead lets make it so everyone struggles together to achieve less than they were aiming for unless they pay us lots of money!\"" Alas this is my opinion and seeing how FreeJam currently is, they won\'t bother looking towards the community for opinions.",0
22061,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewSo I wanted to see what going on with all the commotion with this game after I left it around 6 months ago ( I think but it was a long time). Jumped into a game and was confused with everything; the lasers fired so slowly ( better of with a shotgun really) which defeats the point of and 'smg'. There would be lots of other stuff I would go into detail but I don't want to waste my time with a game I would play everyday but now ruined thanks to FreeJam. If they changed the game to what is was before they added Aero Flaks then I would go back to the game because that's where it went all down hill.,0
22062,Robocraft,2016.0,"- Counter-Strike: Robo OffensiveNo one likes these damn crates. It's a cheap pay-to-win method of sucking the fun out of people who are reluctant to fling their wallets at freejam.- Backwards Evolution Somehow this game seemed to remove more and more balance over time to the point of just throwing every player they can find into matches.- Overpowered Weapons No One Asked ForIt feels like freejam procrastinated so long they forgot they had to make an update, so they just decide to throw in a new, poorly balanced weapon into the game at the last minute as a sorry excuse of progress.- Removal Of Mega BotsI see no real reason why this was even done. It's as if they removed them without knowing why they wanted to or what they were going to do from there.- CraftingThis isn't an update. Freejam literally just replaced the word in the code. This could've been done by anyone who has even taken coding classes in high school. Again a lazy excuse for an update while they roll around cluelessly trying to figure out why the popularity of robocraft is dropping faster than stock prices on black thursday.- Removal Of Armored BlocksAgain no clue what they were going for here. It was fair and balanced, pretty much a major factor in what made robocraft unique. It seems like a good third of my grinding in robocraft was to get better armored blocks, and there they go wiping days of effort.- It's Just Too Complicated For It's Own GoodAnd not in a good way. You can jam all kinds of new content into your game faster than ever before, but that won't make it any better if you don't slow down and put time and effort into it. Sh*t plus sh*t just equals bigger sh*t.- Removal On Limitations Of Gun TypesLetting every bot have whatever kind of weapon they want at any time removes most, if not all diversity in robots, all creativity and design.= In my opinion, that was most of the things the community doesn't like about this game. It's very simple to find out what they dont like as several people have done the very same thing I just did.+ Statement From FreejamFreejam has recently announced that they would be partially fixing some of these issues, such as the crates and tiers. They have even stated they want to remove all ways to buy parts with real money. This is the first positive thing they want to add to robocraft in a long time.~ If robocraft holds true on their plans, I will be more than happy to change my reccomendation for this game.",0

22065,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewMe and my younger brother signifigantly played this game for quite some years even before it showed up on steam and have seen its many itterations. The hours on steam are only a fraction of what we have played overall. Now I myself saw Robocraft going down even before this loot crate system which is to say the least an absolute travesty for this kind of game but a the key sign that the company has lost its orginal vision for money. While yes for new comers this may seem like an awesome game but it is not an excuse for them shafting Veteran players who have put countless hours (even though steam counts them anyway) into a game they whole heartedly enjoyed. The hundreds if not thousand plus hours we had played together can now be thrown aside by a wallet transaction then what was even the point? Beta is beta or in this case Alpha applys only to games that do not have microtranactions. We have spent plenty of money ourselves on this game but now our compensation is just insulting and then finding a game even less free than before. If you want a game right now that can scratch the itch that Robocraft use to or what you would want to I reccomend Crossout without any doubt. Better to pay for a closed beta than an open ""Alpha"" with that spark that Robocraft use to have. Right now stay away from this money grab.",0

Nevertheless my total rating stands at 4/10I have played this game since its early stages and one thing I would like to say is that the devs have no consideration for the people who have put in a lot of hours. There used to be different progression systems and matches where medics were your only source of healing. I myself loved being a medic but after recent updates where after 10 seconds you regenerate, I've been rendered mostly useless as most players run off and don't stick with a medic.I spent so much time grinding to buy higher tier cubes and then comes an update where cubes have no tier, and thus all of my hard work is for nothing. I can't even copmpletely paint my ship the colors I want to anymore.The devs are just becoming money hungry and ruining the game for older players.I do not recommend this game unless you like being disappointed by patches.",0
22070,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewIt's hard to get into the game with how ridiculous they are at changing how the game is played ever-so-often. They even removed some of the core parts that were necessary for beginners like I. I felt it was pointless to continue after these several changes were made, and that these team-based rounds were nothing but a cycle of madness with only such repetition being made countless times, as every time I upgraded my parts, I still end up getting my face wrecked by someone who has even higher level parts than I do. Trying to constantly change my playstyle to even beat a round or two just made the playing experience all the more convoluted, and flight is just as bad. There is no way in hell, as a beginner class, are you going to be able to fly decently in this game, especially after the most recent patches I last saw. The game's devs have basically ♥♥♥♥ed with the game so much, that playing this game is just pointless and not even as fun as it was since I first saw it (which was two years ago). It would have been more enjoyable had some major overhauls that they made to the game did not redact from what it originally was to begin with. (In other words: if it isn't broken, don't fix it).And it's surprisingly still in early access.I still don't understand why they almost seem to be treating this as an official release rather than what is supposed to be a game that needs improvement, because I really doubt it has gotten any better since the day I uninstalled it.The only thing that makes it fun is building your own robot, whether on wheels, feet, or in the air; the creativity part of this game is what makes it good. The major downside to this is how limiting the parts are, which, in order to get any more of these things, you would have to endlessly grind on these online matches just to advance to the next tier of parts, and good luck trying to maintain how much you have to spend on repairing your robots and what parts you have to spend on vs. how much you actually get per round.",0
22071,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game started with the hope that it would build into a great game. Instead the Dev has run all the good game features and balencing that has been done over the past few years, has been run into the ground with one patch. Whats worse, is that instead of trying to fix these terrible design choices, the Dev has said ""Deal with it."" Even if they fix it, I refuse to support a developer with that kind of attitude.",0
22072,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewDon't play this new Epic Loot update. It's a trap for monetary reasons. You'll earn nothing and just spend hours in matches to earn blocks. You can't even reasonably get the items you want to build your own bots anymore. Even if you pay, there's a high likelyhood you'll earn nothing for that money. It's a skinner box and the devs won't listen to change that. Just look on their forums and see the outcry. They only want to deepen their pockets, they care far less for their players.",0
22073,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game was great, and I mean great. But the downfall started when they took out the Pilot Seat. That was, in my opinion, the best part. It meant that there was strategy in hiding your pilot seat, and a tiny little level 1 could take down the biggest robot in one blast. Now, it's as good as youtube promotion. Sure, if you're big you get bigger, but smaller ones have to keep working at twice the rate of the big robots. A big robot can just stick some weapons on a cube and never die, and the tiny robots cant afford the CPU to have that big a creation, and as such are easier to take down. I can imagine next the devs will take away cpu but make all the currency cost real money.EDIT: Spelling and Grammar",0
22074,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is my first review of a game, and I usually dont do these but this game deserves one. This post may seem like just a long rant, but I have put 1700 hours in 8 months into this game, not to mention $100. Then took about an 8 month break and started playing again recently hoping it would be better. I was wrong. It's worse. Freejam has no idea what the definition of the term 'balance' is, and are always drastically changing everything hoping to pump some life into this dyign game. They change the game to whatever they think will work, trying for some weird bastard child of an FPS and MOBA with a creative robot building game, but it is really poorly done and focuses on bad aspects of all the game types. My advice to anyone looking at this game - Don't waste your time. Theres a slight learning curve for which there is no tutorial, the majority of players are just bad at the game as everyone who is good only plays in platoons and steamrolls everyone, and now the payout system is random, so you could spend a month grinding parts for which someone who got lucky could reach the same level in a week if they were dropped the right parts.Some constructive criticism if anyone at Freejam happens to read this. 1 - Stop with the loot crates. Its a really good idea like in csgo, but being paid in items only and praying to RNGesus every game is not a good system. Go back to the economy system and have loot crates as part of an actual economy where repair costs are brough back (to discourage leaving / not trying) and scaled to the time of the game to account for higher RP rewards, and you get paid in RP again, and you can buy loot crates, bots, and parts for RP.2 - Stop trying to go the commie route and nerf / buff everything so that theyre all equal, and stop with the overbuffing and overnerfing. Having niche weapons and movement makes the game fun and allows for more creativity. For example, make wheels faster and be able to easily climb hills like tanks to make up for the CPU cost. Make tanks a bit slower but have more armor, etc.3 - Gameplay. Probably the most fustrating thing about this game, is the stupididty of you average robocraft player. Having a mandatory tutorial, or ever reminders would help a lot. Some people just do not understand that towers and the reactor have connection points that you shoot off to take more out. Either inform people or change it so every crystal is connected, or bring back repair costs and a scaling tier system so that people have to learn and play better to move up. Or just put in a real ranking system because league is a joke. I went from Gold 2 to Platinum 5 in 1 session with a good platoon of players who actually knew what they were doing.3 - Fix the bugs before releasing more content to try and bring people back.

22077,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access Reviewit was a perfect game, nothing was messed up and no matter how each update messed up the game it wasn't that bad. Then this new epic loot update dropped and everything went to hell. Guns fire at stupid slow speed, weapon damage balances got screwed and most of all when you buy in game boxes with real money they don't show up and get lost in the system. It is definitely very disappointing so see a game that was so much fun at 2014 get messed up so badly by just one update. I think my outmost verdict of this game is that Good ol Freejam finally broke the game so badly that to save it they have to roll back the entire update. Guess it was a matter of time as Freejam has been breaking this game for quite some time.",0

22079,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI remember being excited about this game when the first Electroplates were released but now... Now with them removing RP and GC means that the loot system is now extremely poor and some people who had Galaxy Cash lost money and had it converted to 'virtual currency' in an online store, only problem is the conversion rate seems to be unfair in how much it gives. Also with how limited the CPU seems to be I'm usually unable to actually build what I want to build, this is one of the reasons I enjoyed having a Megabot so much.So basically the game was good, but now the devs seem more concerned about getting people to buy premium than making the game enjoyable. I do think it's worth trying but only if you can handle having it take ages to build anything you want and if you don't like being taunted by the visible 'premium only' items at the end of every game.",0

The level system, the blocks, the guns, everything fundamentally changed and it stripped away everything even remotely enjoyable about the game. This game has great potential, but the devs preetty much ran it into the ground for money.

22083,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewNot really sure what happened to this game.I started playing about a little over a year ago and everything made sense, the economy, the way the bots where divided into tiers, the construction process was great! One of my favorite aspects of the game was trying to find more effective ways to build robots. I just tried to play it and everything has completely changed. there is no more stratification in the armor, its unclear (to me at least) how the matchmaking system works, the whole tech tree seems to have dissappeared, the pilot seat is gone (what's the point in thinking about where your blocks go if there is nothing vulnerable??).It's still fun to drive around and blow up other people's bots, but the game seriously lacks the elements that got me really into it in the first place.",0
22084,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewBefore I start I would like to say that I am not trying to hate. If you like the game how it is now that is totally in your hands and is fantastic for you. I liked the game. I think it was a year ago that I played it for the first time. I had seen my friends  play it and when I got in I had massive amounts of fun and it was one of the games that got me into the entire gaming thing. After a while I stopped playing. I was never someone who plays a game for more than a month. After a while I came back. There was a massive update they said. So I went online and searched. The community was raging. So I start the game. I see that levels are now used for items. It annoys me. I played together with my friends and my friends played for far longer but I had the highest level because somehow I gor far more kills. So now the game would be too easy for one of us or too hard for someone else. I quit and now I came back when my friend said that game had updated again. They had removed the wierd level thing. But instaid of that they had installed another wierd system. You now have loot. Soooo that means that it's like destiny now. (I have nothing against destiny but I don't really like the loot system). well I think they should take the game back to the beta version. Back when levels where for blocks. currency for blocks and tech points still existed.Cons: 1. wierd irritating challange ratings2. random loot 3. pay to winCons (for players that played the beta):1. You have to build an entire new robot.2. All money is gone.3. new play styles.4. Too much new weapons5. Very different progres system Tops: 1. a lot of customization2. The actual battle moments are good3. more than one weapon sort on one robot.Conclusion:Well if you are a new player I would say you should try it. If you are a beta player you are in for a shock. The game now has so many weapons that everybody has his own play style. That said I am stil using a (modified) version of my old vehicle and I am doing ok. The thing is that you will almost never stumble into a game where people work together because everyone has different weapons. And if you want to build a robot you will have to slowly build it up by the round.,0
22085,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI'm giving this a mixed review.  On a 5 star system it would be 2.5 .When the servers are not suffering from connectivity problems, and the other players aren't cheating, the game is interesting, even given the poor matchmaking.Here are the negatives:1: Server connectivity is an issue. I have consistent, high speed connection (100M with solid upload), and have drops and lag spikes.2: Players often sit afk to get the lower but automatic exp and crates.  Prob harvesting for profit.3: Straight out, undeniable hacks with invulnerable robots.4: Coordinated botting accounts.  (One person has more than one account.  The bots move together in formation, and perform macro actions).5: Matchmaking pitting experienced against inexperienced bots.  Obvious mismatches by ""cpu.""  I'm experienced and don't  enjoy slaughtering obviously mismatched opponents.Frankly, this is some of the most flagrant and worst cheating I've seen.   Even the ""legitimate"" purchasing of other robot builds eliminates much of the uniqueness and encourages cheats.That being said, when you get into a game with little cheating (won't say no cheating because it's so rare), the game is fun.  Even the bad matchmaking is tolerable periodically.",0

22090,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewJust to finally get my free trading cards, I've just played 2 matches after about 2 years of not playing and boy is it a shell of its former self.I left when you could share your bots with others (because that defeated the whole point of people building their own bots).Now it's a simplified corpse of its former self. Many items are gone, the garages I payed for back then now seem to come for free, I'd have to pay more for colors now, who cares about colors? Lol.Nope.",0
22091,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is probably the most dissapointing game I've played, the old game (its so different it could easily be a different game) had fun, challenging gameplay but now they've scrapped that idea and have made it the exact defenition of a pay to play. This includes overpowered weapons that 1 shot new players, impossibly large sums of money required to get anything at all, premiums get twice as many items from crates as non-premiums, playing in a match with a premium doesn't give you additional money like it used to, I could go on for hours.The largest problem I've encountered is players attaching a really OP weapon to their robot but nothing else and lowering their cpu enough to get into new players' matches, meaning that they'll always win and gain easy loot. This mainly occurs with the new AeroFlak Cannon which, in early games, destroys any ground targets, even though the weapon was designed to be an anti aircraft gun.Secondly the insane cost of items. So you play a match, come first in the team and win, gaining a protonium crate, and gain some stuff you dont want, so you sell it and gain maybe 300 money. Now you want to buy something...oh wait, you can't...because even the cheapest gun costs 400 and selling items gets you less than a tenth of what you can buy it for in some cases. So, you play another match...but there's someone with an AeroFlak, by the way did I mention that the AeroFlak costs 75,000 to buy?But thats not even the most expensive item there is, the lock on rocket launcher (another commonly used cheat weapon) costs 125,000 to buy, and I bet that leaves you wondering ""but how do I get that?"" well the sad answer is... you don't... or at least without spending MORE MONEY.Anyway you obviously loose and get a rusty case and inside you find... some more junk.This has basically described what the game feels like for non-premiums...but wait, what if you are a premium? Well other than costing a TON of money (a single day costs Â£1) it is very good, access to all the paints (yes thats only for premiums), twice the items from crates, custom profile pic ect. All of this has led this game to be very pay to play and it feels as if the developers just don't care enough anymore to change it, they've gotten too greedy with money to think, is this a good, fun game?1/10 huge dissapointment",0

22095,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewIn the beginning it was fun, and kept me busy for a long time. Then I stopped playing it for about 1 year.

22096,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewUsed to be an amazing game, You can add at least another 1000h to my total as I have played a lot on the robocraft launcher on top of my steam launchers hours. However, it seems with every update the game just seems to get worse. It wasn’t perfect of course (what is?) but steadily, with each and every update, more features are removed, more fun sucked out of the game.For everything positive that was added, two features would be removed and some new crap would be added. Freejam caught lightning in a bottle then squandered it.They don’t care about their player base (check the steamcharts if you don’t believe me) tossing everything aside in there rush to their “vision”, a MOBA, E-sport knock off, that copies (badly) features from other, far more popular games that will never be successfully added to the wonderful game they already had.

22097,Robocraft,2017.0,Early Access ReviewIt pains me dearly to thumb down this once great game. I hadn't played it in well over a year since the guys I used to play it with haven't been on much. This was one of my favorite free to play games back in the day but after giving it a quick play earlier today I had a rude awakening. They completely♥♥♥♥♥♥on the mechanics that had originally made the game popular. It went from an ingenious invention based fast paced combat game to a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥pay to win flat game that belongs to that grayed out group of games you've uninstalled.

22098,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access Reviewtl;dr Robocraft was once a fun game, but it isn't anymoreI've played this game for a long time. I played it for a while before linking it to my Steam account, and some more since. For a long time, it was an awesome game with awesome features and a great overall concept. The dev team obviously cared about their players. At some point (within the last two years or so), that changed.Robocraft is now a bloated, unbalanced, pay-to-win mess. The devs spat in the faces of veteran players by removing many of the features that the players had relied on (tech tree and tiering system), and replacing them with confusing overhauls tailored to their new, microtransaction-driven paradigm.I attempted to live with the changes. I revamped my old robots to fit the new changes, but that didn't really change anything. The players who had been playing under the new system longer simply had the advantage of better-invested resources. I couldn't go back and invest the resources I had already spent on things that are useful now that weren't before. The changes put veteran players at a disadvantage have produced awful gameplay.I can't recommend this game. Even for free.",0
22099,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI genuinely used to love this game when it was first brought out. It was fun, innovative and hilarious to see some of the creations players came up with. It was a good mix of builder as well as FPS. I don't know what they were thinking when they made the more recent changes but the game has definitely lost a lot of what made it fun.One of the aspects they removed which I particularly liked was the way their Premium worked. It used to be that anyone in your battle who had premium would increase everyone's reward by 5%; this was very, very sadly removed. This made buying premium feel like it was worth it as everyone benefited from it, but now Premium users only receive more junk in their crates, which is more often than not just as useless.The new loot crate system they have in place feels a lot like its starving players. As an established player I can't imagine how anyone new to this game will be able to make anything capable of standing up to other established players. Barely anything of use is rewarded meaning you have to spend a lot more time in game to be able to even earn simple upgrades for your bot. Salvaging is a painful waste as well as you receive so little currency in return for anything you might not need, and even then you're scrimping through your supplies to find something you can spare to salvage. Everything is stupidly expensive from this perspective as you make so little from salvaging that even purchasing building blocks is painful. You really do need to rely on whatever rewards you earn making it difficult and very time consuming. You can purchase the best crates from the store but this is a money drain as they too aren't guaranteed to give you anything of use.The weapons feel highly unbalanced as anything with high power has a very high cost of energy, often leaving you defenceless. There isn't a tech tree anymore either, so (in my opinion) levelling feels very tedious. I have no desire to level as it feels like I'm not being rewarded and often just feels like work. You don't often earn much in the way of experience from the battle modes, making the most effective means of levelling the Solo Player mode which strips it of its multiplayer aspect. You can earn a bit more experience from the Arena modes, however, due to the weapons, these too feel very unbalanced. More often than not you are up against established players with much better weapons and the more elite items available, e.g. the power shields, so beginner players often don't stand a chance.The Megabots were one of the best parts of the game and they too were removed. They offered a direction for battle which was good aspect as it felt like there was a leader. Having someone to follow and support more often helped the game's direction. Their components however remain in game but at stupidly high costs for both in game currency and pFlop requirements which makes them almost pointless, as you often can't afford to equip them even if you could afford to purchase them. So established players also hold this over beginning players as they have these mega weapons and beginning players are less likely to ever get them.From the outside it seems a lot like the developers are trying to cater to the more negative comments from players and the Robocraft Community. It's been stripped, twisted and turned into something that feels almost like an entirely different game to how it was. It's a shame to see what it's become, as it really did start off going from strength to strength only to hit this very disappointing low.SUMMARY- Paid Premium is almost useless and only gives Premium users an extra chance at useless junk in their loot crates.- Loot crates offer very little of anything useful and purchasing premium crates doesn't guarantee useful equipment which is starving new players. It's near impossible to build or upgrade bots unless you put in very large amounts of time.- Salvaging for currency is a joke; Salvaging only returns a very minimal amount of currency making it nearly impossible to purchase items. This along with the very random, often useless returns from the loot crate means nothing you receive is worth salvaging, and if it is, is too badly needed to afford being salvaged.- Megabots were removed, but their components are still in game but aren't cost or pFlop efficient. This took out a big, fun part of the feel of Robocraft.",0

22101,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewWith recent updates, Robocraft has died. The main reason people loved it was because of the creativity it allowed to thrive. The ability to create wonderous designs after constant tweaking, spending hours creating a perfect machine of both functionality and style, and finally testing it in battle against countless others who had done the same. Seeing bits of your Robo getting blasted off, yet feeling relief that the cleverness of your design allows you to continue the fight without the missing pieces. Having your entire Robot being destoryed in a Death Match, yet being able to rejoin the fight thanks to a repairbot and the built-in escape pod that you spent weeks perfecting.It is all gone now.In its place, we have a ruined husk that is more akin to a facebook game than the glory of what it used to be. The game is now entirely around trying to drain its players of as much money as possible. You don't get the feeling of progress after every match like you used to, instead, you can't move forward at all without shilling out insane amounts of money. You can forget about using the ingame currency to buy the parts you needed, that isn't an option anymore.

A while back they gave stupid fast regen if out of combat for 10 seconds and that eliminated the need for a medic because people just run away heal and come back. I moved to plasma launchers which were a mass shot of exploding projectiles. Absolutely crap against nimble enemies, high speed cars or jet-flyers, but anyone caught in the artillery-like blast was doom sauced.

22112,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThe first time I played this, I was confused and clueless, but I had a blast! This game is one of the most unique ones I've ever played, or ever made and highly enjoyable. The more enjoyable the game will be the more you experiment your own vehicle and the more you try to be creative. Updates always come, making the game better and better, but now... It's just a plain piece of junk... The game is getting more and more Pay-to-Win, unfriendly towards Free Players, and overall greedy! We used to be patient and try to be as skilled as possible, but now you just have to pray to get the good stuff, not to work hard for them anymore! The worst part is that they changed our choices.Back then, we could either immediately buy the cheap stuff that you think you'll one day need or save the robopoints (now ""robits"") so you could finally buy that awesome gun everyone else keeps killing you with. But now you just have to pray to get the good stuff in a crate... You're no longer working hard and rewarding yourself, instead, you'll gamble and hope to get a good item and almost never getting the one you actually want or need!Back then, we could either be Snipers providing cover for the ones fighting for the team or be an SMG tank roaming around and messing with enemies as you drain their health. There used to be class system! The game is completely balaned since us players have Strengths and Weaknesses. SMG > Planes, Snipers > Plasma Tanks, Plasma Tanks > SMG. But now, it's just a messy war with players filling their vehicles with random stuff, making it unfair for ""weaker"" robots.Back then, we could buy Galaxy cash and go Premium to get awesome cosmetics and extra robopoints are only given to Premium Players, or just work hard and not care about design. But now, Premium players could also get Crates full of hyper good things that Free Players will take forever to have and High-Teir weapons they get in a blink of an eye. Giving them unfair advantage from the Free Players! Want balance? Go Premium!Back then, we could decide whether to use Plasma Cannons that require Prediction and Timing, Rail Snipers that require Accuracy and Steadiness, SMGs that require Numbers and Speed, or Nano Disruptors that require Companionship and Judgement. They all take skill, experimentation, and practice. But now, Tesla Slicers, Ion Distorter, Proton Seeker, and Lock-on missiles? All we have to do is to charge at enemies, get closer to them, and select a target to do some damage! All you need is an instructions manual to destroy a lot of players with ease!The game's awards are used to be achievements, something for the devs to be proud and inspired of! Don't let the destruction of the game make these awards turn into advertisements to decieve players believing this game is a gem!Freejam! Valve listens to its community and requests giving what players want to make TF2 and others balanced, enjoyable, friendly, fair, and not Pay-to-Win!Be like them!",0
22113,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game went down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when this update came. Before the update it really meant something to shoot down a plane or helicopter with your Rail Piecer, and when you leveled up it meant something, but no this update just said ♥♥♥♥ you to those thing (and more things) and just wants your money with these crates. P.S Please Freejam bring back the old Robocraft that we as a community loved.",0
22114,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewFinally uninstalled this trash heap of a game. Between the constant disconnects of players on both teams, and the horrible balance of parts and weapons in the game by incompetant developers, its no surprise this game didnt even make the top 10 in the Indie DB awards for 2016.Feels like the people making this game have no idea what they are doing or what they want this game to be. Its a complete mess.",0
22115,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewGame looks bad, game runs fairly bad. This game used to be good, but the devs took out everything that made it good: Megabots, teirs, pilot seats to name a few.Then they removed galaxy cash, merged all the teirs and forced everyone to grind their asses off with crates. That was the nail in the coffin. The gameplay is fairly boring too without megabots. SMGs feel like throwing toilet paper at people and the higher teir players are still significantly more powerful than new players. I could care less about the new guns they have been adding, there are some huge fundamental issues with this game at the moment and i highly reccomend that you stay away from this one.",0
22116,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI had such high hopes for this game... but these developers are utterly incompetent, greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that don't care about your gaming experience. I don't think I've ever witnessed them fix anything in this game, rather any issue persists as long as it takes for them to completely replace it with something else usually worse. Really, I've tried, I can't think of any. The building aspect was amazing when I started playing about two years ago, it actually mattered where you put your blocks and how well you protected your pilot seat, the ability to actually engineer a robot is now virtually non-existent without any kind of pilot seat/control module. Gameplay used to be a competitive and rewarding teamplay experience, now that you get auto-heals and auto-lock missiles, there's no incentive for anyone to protect, heal, or support anyone else. They've nerfed any competetive aspect over and over to the point where pretty much whoever arrives or fires first will probably win. If you're down a teammate, which happens a looot as there is no way to reconnect to a match, you pretty much have no control over how screwed you are.It'd make your head hurt trying to understand all the ways they've accidentally succeeded in disallowing me to play with my brothers, alienating their users, and going against their own core concepts. I really don't know how to condense the book that I can write about all the good and bad in this game, but as the good seems to be gone and the bad is now worse, I'll just highlight a couple things that have either amused or ticked me off over the years:There was a ""rectifier"" that would pulse energy to flip you over if you ended up on your back, it was pretty cool this was taken away and we were given a 10 second auto-flip that lifts you up into the air and surrounds you in a swirly light that's like a billboard for the enemy team. Instead of knowing my own robot for how I built it and using my rectifiers as a tool, I now avoid ending up on my back only because of this new punishment they've forced on all of us or just let it go as a death if I do. This was maybe one of my favorite items in game, but I'm sure simple players were complaining about them being shot off (duh, protect them) or not working correcly after your robot is half destroyed (duh, place them better). This is a prime example of how they cater to the lowest common denomination of lazy, unskilled players, and then needlessly take from the rest of us to keep things in line with their idea of fair.At one point, they implemented multiple servers to be able to handle more users, but rather than letting each one handle users as it filled up, they simply divided up all the players equally amongst the servers. Guess what? Each server was starved for users and queue times instantly went up from only a few seconds to regularly over a half hour to an hour just to play a single match. This persisted for the better part of a year, meanwhile they seemed entirely clueless or unwilling to fix what they caused while regurgitating over and over that they just needed more players. ...Then, as it was finally getting better, they did it again! It just goes to show, whether they understood their mistake or not, they don't care what you have to go through. Seriously, from just a couple of seconds (it was incredible) to over 30 minutes on average, for over a year and they did nothing.There is this beep that lets you know when a platoon member is ready to battle, it seemed to work until after a patch, then once the beep started it didn't stop. It was useful at first, but then just frustrating, and they never fixed it...Each garage got a ""X2"" bonus for the first win of the day, they moved the ""X2"" to the garage icon and to the outer edge of the garage floor, but it also never went away. It was useful at first, but then just frustrating, and they never fixed it...Yet more issues that persisted for a year or so before just being removed entirely. Yep, that's right, no X2 bonus anymore because linking a graphic to a script was waaay to big of a job for them to handle (and wouldn't directly make them any money).This game has made me want to swear off early access games, but given that Freejam expects you will pay $20-$40 for one crappy robot and then shows no concern for any issues you might have, I really think it's just the people working on it that are the problem. I can't be mad at Robocraft, it used to be amazing, but the developers have ruined it to a point that I find unplayable. I'm more sad for the game, like when you see a smart kid unable to shine under an obliviously ignorant parent. Their vision seems to have gone from building an awesome game that nobody else hase, to blatantly copying other games in the hopes it will magically make them money. I mean, loot crates? Seriously? It might not be so bad if they hadn't also at the same time taken away the in-game currency that I paid for, but it's still pretty bad because I have no need for anything the crates give me. Screw you jerks, I want my money back!Oh, and megabots, I'm so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ You have no idea how many hours I've spent building my mega, and now they're just gone. I'm really looking forward to hearing your reason for this one, Freejam, because all the problems you remove rather than fix always seem to be your own fault in the first place. These guys obviously can't manage their own code, but I'm pretty confident that they can't write it either and that they are paying someone else to do it. So we pay them, to pay themselves, to pay someone else to do their work, and that someone else for sure cares less about us players than Freejam does. To be completely fair, every time they take something away from me (pretty much every patch), I try to look at it like a whole new game. So then the game isn't as great as it was, but is still a pretty good game in itself at that point, then it's just good, then just okay, then disappointing, then more disappointing, now it's just bad.",0
22117,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewIt was a great game before -- before the latest shape of the, the game was pretty fun, you could build your own vehicle/robot as you were free to buy any part you need as long as you researched it on tech tree. It was more balanced, more fun and you had a lot of freedom and spending real money wasnt necessery to play it. Now.... now those i listed are no more.. There is a system of chance to drop parts which could be the one you seek or not. It's more like CS:GO right now, you need to buy boxes to sustain your gameplay otherwise, those who spend money on boxes will dominate the game. Long story short, if you're looking for a free-to-play online game, don't even consider this -- its like a smartphone game now... Don't play it if you ask me..",0
22118,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThought I could build some robots and go fighting but instead I was left in the dark and now have a garage with no robots and my only option seems to be to pay money and buy someone else's robot.,0
22119,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewWhat started out as a fun, original, and creative multiplayer indie game that I was able to enjoy for hours on end, has slowley devolved into a clusterf**k of freemium  bulls**t. The best gear being locked behind a ""premium membership"" and purchasing items without any addition payment of real life currency has made Robocraft significantly less enjoyable to play. At this point, its starting to look like a mobile app. What happened to you Robocraft?",0
22120,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is probably the most dissapointing game I've played, the old game (its so different it could easily be a different game) had fun, challenging gameplay but now they've scrapped that idea and have made it the exact defenition of a pay to play. This includes overpowered weapons that 1 shot new players, impossibly large sums of money required to get anything at all, premiums get twice as many items from crates as non-premiums, playing in a match with a premium doesn't give you additional money like it used to, I could go on for hours.The largest problem I've encountered is players attaching a really OP weapon to their robot but nothing else and lowering their cpu enough to get into new players' matches, meaning that they'll always win and gain easy loot. This mainly occurs with the new AeroFlak Cannon which, in early games, destroys any ground targets, even though the weapon was designed to be an anti aircraft gun.Secondly the insane cost of items. So you play a match, come first in the team and win, gaining a protonium crate, and gain some stuff you dont want, so you sell it and gain maybe 300 money. Now you want to buy something...oh wait, you can't...because even the cheapest gun costs 400 and selling items gets you less than a tenth of what you can buy it for in some cases. So, you play another match...but there's someone with an AeroFlak, by the way did I mention that the AeroFlak costs 75,000 to buy?But thats not even the most expensive item there is, the lock on rocket launcher (another commonly used cheat weapon) costs 125,000 to buy, and I bet that leaves you wondering ""but how do I get that?"" well the sad answer is... you don't... or at least without spending MORE MONEY.Anyway you obviously loose and get a rusty case and inside you find... some more junk.This has basically described what the game feels like for non-premiums...but wait, what if you are a premium? Well other than costing a TON of money (a single day costs £1) it is very good, access to all the paints (yes thats only for premiums), twice the items from crates, custom profile pic ect. All of this has led this game to be very pay to play and it feels as if the developers just don't care enough anymore to change it, they've gotten too greedy with money to think, is this a good, fun game?1/10 huge dissapointment",0
22121,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game was once a lot of fun, however after 1 year the game has been completely destoyed by ""improvement updates"". This game has become a full on pay to win, it used to be about skill to unlock parts but now its if you are lucky enough with loot crates, and increase your chance with premium. I used to have an awesome tech tree, level system and player matching but now its all but been destroyed so the devs can make more money by forcing you to buy premium to have fun.",0
22122,Robocraft,2016.0,"This game was great;it used to be an epic arena, a place where you fail a fight and think ""well, how can I improve my robot so that next time, i don't loose this fight?"" it was great! you would progress not because you played more, but because you became more skilled at the game.then they decided that wasn't user firendly. of course, if you have to learn something to get good at the game, less people will be interested, resulting in less money for you.now, the game is a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to the question you asked yourself before ""what can I do better?"" the only viable answer is ""Either buy premium or farm money in order to get the next weapon tier"". nothing more. skill is gone, building skill is gone. there is only money.",0
22123,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe first time I played this game, it was alright. It had the typical tech tree system you'd see in some other games of the same nature, but in this one you created your own fighter with it's own special mechanics. You had to get quite invested into a certain branch in the tech tree to get the best part from it (Which is good, that makes sense.) Then I sorta drew away from the game as I started playing others. I came back a while later after my friend started playing and said I should redownload. So I did, and I played an- WHAT?! So now your level is linked to the parts you can buy? Welp, I'm a pretty high level, so this shouldn't be a problem. Then I repeat, un-install, wait, re-download.What the hell. So now you can buy ANY goddamn part you want? The game seems to have transformed from a competent, fun action game into this mess of micro-transactions. YES, CRATES, IN-GAME CURRENCY, we don't need the old fans, just grab in some new players and make them buy stuff! This game doesn't need anymore dedicated players who could've spent hours trying to get a single part, now you can buy that♥♥♥♥♥♥and give us more money!",0
22124,Robocraft,2017.0,"To be honest, if you're reading this review, I'll get straight to the point. This game has a good concept, great idea, Robocraft is original indeed but...It's not the same thing like somewhen. Before you had: tiers, less equipment, WOT-like gamemode but teams were fair. Not like now. You're thrown at players (that have spent a lot of time, or money, or both) who have everything. Now you have to get better equipment right? to do so, you have to defeat enemies right? But how are you supposed to do that when each your enemy is like you x3??? back when there were tiers you used to play gainst players on your or one less/higher tier, and that was what I call balance which somewhere, one the way to now was killed and I hope, in future restored. For now I don't recommend you this game but maybe in the future it'll be worth your time.",0
22125,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThe Teir system was changed, now even in the lowest Tier you get destroyed by way to strong, way to expensive weapons. Saving to get them is basically not possable without a ton of farming. Not fun at all anymore.",0
22126,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewFirst off, this game has good mechanics, and it runs smoothly on even bad computers, thing is, th server connections can cause you to freeze in game, dragging your mouse cursor to the middle of the screen and prevnting you from canceling or retrying a connection to chat, thats right, the chat servers are virtually required to play the game, otherwise you sit theere racking up points for the jackass guy at spawn. secondly, in order to paint your robot with primary colors, like red or yellow, you either have to get  lucky enough to catch a premium promo code or gmail event, or buy  premium, on top of that, the teir  system is god awful with inexperienced or just low level players getting their asses kicked by pro players with top teir bots.The original game mode, which i liked, was a simple 2 team deathmatch, where you dfid not respawn, and it was fight to the death, thats gone, The AI training area where you fought in arena against AI players in a ffa, gone. replaced with a 2 team deathmatch where low level players get one team and high level players get the other, and you sit and get killed for 15 games in a row until you can scrounge up enough exp and crap items to get a slightly less pathetic bot created.Skill is usually not as much a decider as how many shield you can tack onto a bot, and weapons come down to how many can you spam at the enemies shield, the only skill requiring battles are ground V Air battles, or vice versa, where aim and flight skills trump pure weapon and shield power.Those are the downsides.The game has a diverse selection of maneuverabilities, including flight, treads, speedy wheels, legs, spider legs, rockets and tomarrow, propellers.Weapon systems are interesting with high power gravity effected plasma, to low power smg spammer, to high power sniper rail guns, to low power healing beams, to high power blades, to low power... you get the pointShield geomatry allows for the optimal weapon and surface area coverage, with tons of shapes to choose from.Curved blocks, slanted blocks, blocks, glass, helium, uhh, corners, slanted corners, smooth corners, etc4 colors to choose from (barring premium colors) Light blue, Orange, Grey and white. <thats some amazing customization right thereuhh, sounds that happen when you do stuff, a Tutorial where you learn the basics of placing blocks, then you walk around, then you shoot an immobile mech guy with aesthetic paint and armor that makes you wish you weren't a total noob and had that♥♥♥♥♥♥optomized uhh, aiming system where you can zoom in, and you point at stuffAdsSee cool designs on the front cover of the game, than go ingame and see maybe 2 good designs every 10 battles that also work in combat.camping.Regenerating to full health by hiding like a wuss for 7 secondsFlagshaving friendsTotally violently active chat that makes you wish this was not sarcasmA penalty added to  you if your game glitches and forces you to shut it down at the start of a game.4 garages to build robots in!a shop.More contentand uhh... uhh...... ... ... ......... \..stuff.so you see this game is decent, would i recommend it, probably not, which why i said no, but if you do want to play this game, make sure you have more patients than a chronic AdVenture Capitalist player.Yeah.This game is ok ",0
22127,Robocraft,,"change this game has made since 2015 has really cut into me one way or another. Robocraft was once a pinnacle of what free-to-play games should be. Viable and exciting progression, entertaining and easy mechanics, and a wealth of fun for all players. The tiering system was expansive, the items easy to unlock, and every aspect was simple. Every aspect was comprehensive. Nearly all of my (at the time of writing) ~310 hours of playing were sank during those so called ""glory days."" My friends and I earned every aspect of our play, and was proud of my stance. I EARNED tier 10. I EARNED Mega. I EARNED every single item in my inventory through dedicated play. Suddenly, it was the rebalancing. Items began rampantly having stats changed, tried and true strats became useless, and cheese strats ran amok. This crucial point in time denoted the point where the devs lost contact with the game. After this, it was a near tectonic shift in the direction of the game. The devs turned a once-loved game into a cash cow, and began squeezing the life out of players little by little with destructive patches and planar-shifts in game direction every few MONTHS. It eventually lead to the way obtaining items had been since forever being changed to some lunacy of a system that I, honestly, spent no time learning because I had already gotten most of the parts I wanted. The real kicker was what happened to the currency system here. They ported your basic currency, and then gave you a sickening fraction of your premium currency transformed into the basic currency, forcing them together. For the thousand-some premium I had, I got a mere 10k. And, yes, 10k seems like a lot, until you find out that a SINGLE ""T10"" (tiers had been removed not long earlier) cost anywhere in the ballpark of 100-300k if my memory serves me right. Previously, one of those would cost oh, say, 600 premium currency? It's been a few years since! You were also rewarded NOTHING for Tech Points, the progression system, and any support ticket for this injustice was responded with a ""eat crap and die"" kind of reaction.Robocraft had its cornerstones butchered, and even today remains a sad husk of what it used to be. I look back frequently to what this game used to be, and feel severely bereft of the love and experience I had, running home after highschool to boot up one of my favorite games with my friends, only to be thrown in the trash with all of the other traditionalists. Compared to when I started in 2014, this game is a sad excuse, and it pains me. I feel no connection to the current state of the game, I feel no love, but what I do feel is a deep wound of offense, especially seeing how its taken almost four years for them to even barely restore a piece of the best part of this game. Not only do I hate what it is now, I hate having seen such a great game collapse on its knees to perpetuate greed.",0
22128,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access Reviewlook i would LOVE to give this game a positive review but i can't. it can be fun sometimes but most of the time your team gets whooped by the enemy team cause they spent more money on crates, and NOBODY EVER COMUNICATES! you will get a 1/1000000 chance of getting ONE other person who will actually speak more than""this team sucks im better than all of you"" plus this game is SUPER pay to win. if you dont get premium, say goodbye to most customization options and HALF OF THE LOOT YOU EARN. im not joking without premium, you only get half of the loot crate contents. WOAH YOU GOT A LEGENDARY? WELL FIRST YOU GOTTA PAY PREMIUM FOR THAT. also good luck getting the parts you need because everything you can sell for in game credits, is only worth about 1/5 of how much in game credits it costs to buy the same thing you are selling. for example: ghoast module is a LEGENDARY item. you get get it in the in game block store for roughly 150,000 in game credits. you can only sell it for about 30,000 IN GAME CREDITS. WHY? there is SO much more i want to say but I can't rant for too long so this is all but i have some advice: instead of making a free game where over half the content is locked behind a pay wall which, you should know to get permanent premium costs about 50-100$, you should just make your game cost money instead! make the game 10, 20, heck maybe even 50$ if your that greedy, but dont lock over half of the actuall game behind a pay wall.",0
22129,Robocraft,2017.0,Early Access ReviewFor the most part i have had a desent experience with robocraft. Although it is considered a  free game it is impossible to play without premium.

22130,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewNew updates have ruined this game.

22132,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI decided to give this game a try after 2 years of development since I last played, and holy god, where did this game go so wrong?At first glance, you may think this game is about building a vehicle and fighting other players with it. You'd be correct in thinking so, however, the games balancing system is utterly poor so you'll be facing enemy vehicles that are three times your power level meaning you can't kill them, and they can destroy you with a click of a button. Does that sound fun to you? You really can't progress through the game like this.In my all honest opinion, I do not think this game is worth getting into, maybe as a new player to Robocraft, you'll enjoy it more than us Veterans trying it out for the first time in a while.",0

I was devastated I could not earn money I could not sell stuff for money right now I'am worse then I person starting the dame game.I remember the game before the update the were things wrong with it like the robots made from corner cube that took no damage but I had a warp drive Missile launchers I could just mess around and try new combinations of weapons knew designs.I'am sorry devs I can't play Robocraft anymore because  I have no wheels two guns and some bricks the only thing a could make is is a sniper tower or a stick that falls over when ever I shoot This game will forever be in my steam library. not for the game play, not for weapons, not even for the cool robots. It will be in my steam library for the memory of a 10/10 game that has lost it's touch. overall game rating with money 8/10 you can play it overall without money as said above I can't play or get the proper experience of the game do to lack of money 1/10 If the devs are reading this give you game a test play please test it without premium see how far you get in the game see the struggles people like me have as said before I had ever single gun in the game but now I can't even afford a level one machine gun.",0

It has changed from being progressive, challenging and rewarding to being stagnant, tedious and insulting.  I used to play this for a few hours most nights, but if I now log a couple of hours a month then I'm doing well.The direction of the game has completely changed. A while ago, there was an aim to work towards, I recognised a lot of players, even teamed with some of them.  Now, I don't recognise anyone, nobody chats, and at the end of a game, you just receive spare parts that you can scrap for a fraction of their value; this contributes to the tedium.It is such a shame as I really enjoyed the game, both building bots and taking part in battles.  It's not fun any more.",0
22139,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThe last update just made the game so bad because those reasons:1.Money has no value anymore.2.The game now it's about your luck, if you were lucky you get legendry.3.The lucky players can get more legendery weapons because they always win and top score so they keep get the best.4.The new players can reach high lvl fast if they are lucky.*Please make the game what it was before* ;(",0

22146,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFirstly, there are >200 hours of non-Steam play time.Alright, Robocraft was a great game back in 2014. Your goal was extremely simple - build anything you want, arm it with some (or many) lasers and fight! The battles were extremely dynamic though being simple - drive to the map center and fight to death! Despite there were 3 times less modules the customization was much bigger. Why? There were no ultimate machines - even a car with four wheels and a pair of guns could pwn.Also, there were only light, heavy, glass chassis blocks and 5 armor levels, nowadays there are no armor cubes (Robocraft degrades too, lol).When did it all started? When the plasma was added. It was the first op-thing to be implemented. Bombers ruled the battles, people who could build a spin-bomber (plasma could only be placed on the top of the block at this time) were the Robocraft kings. But that didn't stopped me. I've continued building my gunbeds (Phoenix, Titan and Lapis tanks, eh, old times).After some time the railguns were added and laser fire range was fixed - it came to be infinite. It was the peak of Robocraft. The best times.Then.. it started to degrade.More modules led to the overpowered bombers and drones. Anything land-based could be destroyed in a single plasma strike. But to make things worse, FreeJams have added the repair cost. And that was the worst time in Robocraft.You just simply couldn't use anything above Tier 6 (yeah, there were Tiers and Robo Ranking) without premium, so Robocraft was claimed pay-to-win for that. One unlucky battle could erase your money from the past 5 lucky battles.I've nearly not played Robocraft at this time - it wasn't attractive for me.Repair costs were deleted, later.And then Robocraft started to degrade at full force.Megabots weren't so cool as we thought.New weapons were too useless or too overpowered. Overpowered guns have been later fixed and now they are useless too.The game has been too simplified. No Tech Points anymore, for example.Community Robot Factory was the second biggest mistake.. no, it's the first biggest (repair costs are the second) mistake FJs have ever done. The coolest aspect of Robocraft, building, was zeroed.And what do we see now? No money anymore. CRF overpowered bots everywhere. Anything hand-made is unplayable.Weapon switch. Energy. 10 sec regeneration. Auto-aim guns. 10 hours to make a single gun.Finally, CASES? Is it just me who thinks that sandbox game shouldn't use the randomness?So-o, that's Robocraft, degraded and simplified. It could be a great game, with its great potential.. but Freejams have chosen a wrong way. If you still want to play it - try, but it doesn't worth my time anymore.TheSol out.",0
22147,Robocraft,2017.0,"Back in the day when I used to play Robocraft I absolutely loved it, the simplicity, yet the fun I could get from it was amazing, I used to play this; building, fighting and searching, for hours on end, I think to myself now, that if the game was still how it used to be, how much more I would have been playing it to this day.But then started it's downfall, within some of the bigger updates they ruined the game, this used to be one of my favourites, but now it's just another game in my library. They changed it that much, that it might as well be a different game, I did like many of the things they added, like certain parts, but most of the decisions they made, made that big of an impact, that it is no longer the same game for me.I wouldn't even consider playing this again, it used to be so simple and that was why I loved it so much! But they just kept bringing these new updates that ruined how the game played out overall.",0
22148,Robocraft,2018.0,"i had 2000 hrs on this game it got updated over the years each update favored drone builds , i had to uninstall my premium life time account because mechs were no longer combat effective vs drones , i find this game is misleading new players with its artwork .  The game is full of just tiny damage boost ..drones.    anyone expecting any form of mech combat or tank or chopper combat is going to be clubbed by these pro drone builds.  soo why does robocraft continue this artwork with artbots advertising thier broken game ?",0
22149,Robocraft,2018.0,"Used to play this game back in the good old days.  Back before you had flying and the energy shield stuff. Put about $40 into it and a little over 140 hrs.  Stopped shortly after the raming blade things were added since they had changed it so much.  To my dissapoitment, it seems that the developers have taken the game in a completely different direction then the fun game I had enjoyed 3 years ago.  Redownloaded the game and right off the start it informs me that some of my items have become obsolete.  I was like ""alright thats fine hopefully I can build something cool that functions""  I look garages and don't see too much.  Then I try and build a new robot, here is where the problem comes in. -I only have T1 blocks, I have robots that have T5 and T4 blocks built in, but none of my ""inventory"" has any blocks but T1 blocks unlocked.  -Next problem, I try and look for a tech tree, see the tech tree was one of those things I actually really enjoyed about robocraft, you could branch off into certain areas and maybe you would have T2 or 3 lasers but would have T6 blasters bc you prefered blasters over the more sniper focused lasers.  The tech tree, gone, couldn't find it anywhere. Looked at some wiki pages and I find that the tech tree has been removed.-Problem three, I downloaded the game I would say a year ago when they started to do all these changes.  Now given from when I had first stopped playing until the time I redownloaded a year ago they changed how garages worked.  You used to have to buy garages with money that you bought.  The money I spent on the game went primarily to buying garages so I could test new designs out.  The problem I had when I redownloaded was that first they didn't reimburse me for the credits that I payed for with my money for the garages that are now free and second they removed the remaining ingame cash I had spent actual money on to get, not the currency you earn from playing matches but the stuff you get from spending money.  I proceed to send emails every day for 2 weeks asking where the money I spent went and if they would reimburse me with either ingame currency or some other means.  NO RESPONSE.  The devs just took my money, didn't say oh hey here is a replacement, just took it and I think that that's what pisses me off the most is the fact that they took my money, changed the system so what I spent my money on was now useless, didn't reimburse me, and ontop of that removed all the other currency that I spent actual money on away from my account.2015 Robocraft 92/100:Amazing gameAllowed for creativityHad a Tech TreeWas much Simplier and a lot of joke designs actually sometimes workedYou weren't scammed out of your moneyThere was a slow grind when you hit T72018 Robocraft 6/100:Scammed me out of my moneyDoesn't have a Tech TreeHas weird progression systemDesigns don't seem to be as open to creativity and functionality at the same time, pick one or the otherDo explination of new systemIf a dev or someone on the team would reach out to me and help me get my currency back it would be much appreciated.Also have more ideas on how the game could possibly be improved if a dev would like some input since seems that some of the devs do respond.  Overall though this game has really been on the decline and I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone, go play world of tanks or another game by Wargaming, they make nice games and don't scam you out of the things you buy",0

22151,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access Review(there's an unbelievable tweet by seb I'll link at the end of this review.)TLDR: The game had a golden period, and dipped below iDubbbz eating peaches in a sewer. Don't play.This game is the equivalent of an indecisive 5 year old who wants to be everything on Halloween, with constant bursts of unrealistic ideas.Robocraft at one point had a decent ranking system, a good currency system, and basically a good everything else. It seems as if the developers didn't see what promise they had, and consequently shoved the whole thing down a toilet full of polished turds. There seems to be a misallocation of priority, with all of it going towards radically changing the base game rather than actually listening to the players, and fixing the game.The old tiering system worked fine, along with the different tiers of armor you could have. It gave a clear difference between the tiers, and actually was something to work towards upgrading. The currency system was also working well, as it didn't give too much money to the point progress was too easy, and never too little to make things seem impossible. But, literally all of that got thrown out the window in favor for absolutely worthless crates and pay-to-win mechanics. The weapons long ago actually had a clear difference as to what they were used for, but again, it was thrown out in favor of new weapons that you're encouraged to buy with real money.If you've heard the saying, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" you could very safely assume the developers haven't.Almost everything this game had was golden, but it seems Freejam has caught some sort of contagious mental illness amongst it's staff, and as a result their game was thrown down the company ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and repeatedly defecated on. There is literally /ZERO/ ideas being taken from the community, despite what their numerous announcements say. Not a single mind wanted these changes, Freejam.In short, stay very well away from this game until some miracle worker comes along and fixes the game, or that mental illness Freejam caught subsides.seb's tweet: https://twitter.com/sebify/status/726734941178990592 ",0

22165,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewEmphasis on skillful design and consideration in building your robot has been thrown under the bus in favor of modern FPS quirks like regenerating health and lack of a cockpit. All vehicles can be built to be independant and promote anti-social team composition as nobody has a reason to cooperate or build toward specific roles and designs.

22166,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewRandomized drops in a game about building things is dumb. Increasing the cost of every single part in the game via the implementation of a recycling system that gives you far less of the value of the part than before? Even dumber.,0
22167,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewRobocraft. Robocraft is meant to be a fun enjoyable game but now this game has turned into a pile of s***. when I first played this game it was enjoyable up until the update came out now this game feels like a mobile game with microtransactions everywhere. when I first played this game you could buy the beginning weels for free and the blocks for free  now you have to use in-game money to buy everything and that has ruined this game.  and also the fact that they added Loot Crate's was a good idea. but here's the bad part you don't get everything from The Loot Crate's unless you have a PREMIUM ACCOUNT!!!. what is the point of there being Loot Crate's if you need to buy a PREMIUM ACCOUNT!!! to get everything from it and since you need a PREMIUM ACCOUNT!!! what is the point of the Loot Crate's ?!?!?!?.I am very disappointed at the Developers they have ruined this game this lovely game they have ruined.,0
22168,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewLets face it, this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ It started as neat game with cool game mechanics and lots of potential with the currency sytems. But now it is a full on pay to win.   Lets start by discussing the currency system I mentioned previously. This currency system allows players to either farm currency or, pay for it. It had good potential for the unpatient players, but then, the unpaid currency rose dramaticly. The prices went from a couple hundred to a couple thousand for the unpaid currency. And no increase in player income, unless they purchase premium. However, the paid curency droped in prices. Costing hundreds and sometimes even just 25!   Before I get too negative on the game the mechanics are flawlessly done, paying attention to details such as wait balance and manuverability (can't spell). It takes the player into a whole new relm of thinking. They actualy have to pay attention to the physics of the game. Wow! Instead of just mindlessly slaping parts together you have to think about how it will perform in battle. For example, I can't just strap 100 cannons on my rig as it would be to large and heavy. I have to think do I really want a tank or a balanced vehicle. This mechanic aslo gives a bit more freedom to the player.   The graphics are what you would expect for a free to play game, decent, and can run on any machine. Although I can't really judge those as a have a patatoe for a PC.    All in all, this game had so much potential but coulden't execute it with it's cheesy pay to win and funding. It failed to complete it's goal. Unless it was make money and  I had somewhat of a time but the pay to win players dominate the Free to play players. And it becomes a mess of losing streaks. Overall rating: 6/10 Average",0

22170,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewTwo years ago, when I started playing it, I was hoping it would be a good game, but now after about 1k total in game time and countless patch... hope is fading. Every new game mode is less joyful than previous one and game itself becomes more casual which results very random/skill-free teams even at the very endgame. Btw, don't tell me then it is ""only alpha"", because it is at this stage long enough (2 years) to assess direction of changes and this direction is not promising :(Edit: Not worth your time, just stay away :/",0
22171,Robocraft,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter playing this game for over 30 hours and progressing through 4 (almost 5) tiers, I think I'm qualified to write a good, informed review. The concept of this game is to build a functioning robot (it isn't really a robot due to the fact that you have a pilot seat, but that's beside the point) out of the parts they give you, then take this robot into battles. The more you fight with your robot, the more currency you earn (represented by RP) along with Tech Points, which are used to unlock new parts, which are then bought with RP. You must also use RP to repair your bot if it is damaged in battle, and the repair costs varry depending on just how damaged your bot was. Currently, there is only one gamemode in which you must capture the opponent's base before they capture yours. So, if you're a fan of varrying gamemodes I can't really recommend this to you...yet. One major thing that I feel like I should address is that this game does include microtransactions. BUT, before you hear that word and automatically deny the existance of the game, the game is not pay to win in the way that you would be able to notice it while playing a match, and arguably not pay to win at all. The reason for this is that the game works by matching up your bot with other bots which fit in your tier (I saw one of the reviews not recommending the game complaining that they are constantly matched with players in tiers higher then themselves, but I have never had that experience in over 30 hours of gameplay). Due to this system, someone who buys the best parts in the game is going to be automatically moved into the highest tier in the game, where they will still not gain an advantage over other players. If anything, those who pay for parts would have a disadvantage due to the fact that they are not as experienced in building their robots or fighting with them. Building off of my last sentence, the way you build your robot is very important. Someone with the lowest avaliable items in a tier with a well designed bot could still defeat someone with the highest weapons in the tier with a badly-designed bot.Another major aspect of this game is progression through levels. The only time this game gives me the feeling of grinding is after I've maxed out my robot for the tier I'm in but I don't quite want to step up to the next tier yet, which is really only a limit I put on myself. There is rarely a time (in the first 4 tiers anyway, I haven't progressed to the tiers above so I can't speak for those yet) when you get back from a battle and can't afford to upgrade your robot in a at least a minor way, such as upgrading a few sheets of armor. Due to this constant ability to upgrade at least something, I never really feel like I'm grinding away at the next level, but rather slowly progressing through the level towards the next one, something I really enjoy. All in all, Robocraft is a game with a great premise, currently limited gameplay elements (in terms of gamemodes) and a few glitches, but those are to be expected in early access games. I would recommend it to anyone who has ever wanted to be able to build and use the vehicle you take into battle and don't mind the fact that there is curently only one gamemode. To those who are turned away by that fact, there are still 3 maps which provide areas for using different strategies with different robots, adding some sort of variety into the gamemodes. Even if that still doesn't seem like enough of a redeeming factor, just try it anyway, as the worst that can happen if you end up absolutely hating it is that it took up some space on your computer and some of your time.",1
22172,Robocraft,2017.0,"The concept will always be good, But the balancing in the matches are horrendous. You could, and will, get 1 1000+ cpu on the Blue side, And 4 1000+ cpu on red. I also get penalised for disconnecting from a match due to bad internet, Which is not fair.",0

22176,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewPlayed the game once every couple of month. Mostly because progression was tediously slow and matchmaking unbalanced. So when i read the recent reviews, i thought: ""Oh, cmon, how bad can it be, lol?"" Let me tell you that - BAD. Really, really bad. TL;DR - don't play it unless you are Willy the Whale and you ran out of ideas on how to spend your money after financing the college of every stripper in close vicinity. 1. Matchmaking is utter garbage. You get thrown in with people who have the strongest weapons driving on a tiny platform. Sure, a good hit would kill them, but here's the thing - the strongest weapons also have the longest reach, highest accuracy and best dps. Basically if you are up against someone with a better weapon, you already lost unless he doesn't notice you for half a day or you have some buddies with you.2. Loot system about as rewarding as squeezing water out of rocks. You get a crate at the end of the match - it will be a random part. Like, utterly random. I got a wheel, a track and some blocks. While it might be funny to think of a combination of those items, at the end of the day you will have no fun building your robot as a free2player. Your funneh robot loving named ""McFartFace"" will face 105% optimized deathmashines with full-legendary equip.3. The only other form of aquiring parts other than the random lootboxes it destroying the parts you have for 25% of their worth and then buying different stuff. Ofc the prices are exorbitant for anything good. If you can afford it though? You can have invisibility, shields, instakill weapons - against guys with a wheel, a track and some blocks to keep those together. 4. The only people who are still playing this game are toxic max-lvs who have everything unlocked and will call you an autist if you complain about the unfairness of it. (I guess one should be happy to have the honor of being one-hit-killed by them)5. The devs show no remorse and no reasoning. They want cash. I find this theory about lizard-people controlling everything in order to destroy humanity more and more plausible. Otherwise the devs would have to be unbelievably greedy and stupid.P.S. Ofc you could say ""What does he know, he only played a couple of hours, lol"" - well, good luck enduring any more than that as a new player.",0
22177,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI realy want to give this game recomendation but i just cant. Dont get me wrong this is one excelent game with a fatal flaw that cant be overlooked(but could be easily fixed). Match making! My god the irony of that word in this game (its funny when you wait for game to start there is a message saying ""wait untill you are matched fairly"":D). Basicly when i was lvl 30 i was and still am constantly matched with ppl using lvl76 weapons (meaning the are at leest 2.5 times my lvl!) and that was not just one-two gamse with one-two ppl, no its more that half of ppl every game. It kills all the joy of lvling coz whats the poing of geting a new weapon when  you know its already underpowerd compered to standard weapons used. Im lvl 53 now and i almost stoped playing coz im just not having fun anymore. I dont know if there are not enough players or what but this is deal breaker for me...",0

22180,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI started playing this a few days ago. As a new player, I have observed that a lot of matches are one-sided stompfests. If you don't spend real life money to load up on epic or legendary items, then prepare to get your robot stomped into the ground over and over again every match. A waste of time unless you're willing to drop cash to roll for epic/legendary items before ever setting foot in a match.Edit: After putting more hours into the game, I find the gameplay to be flawed. Every map is filled with close quarters and objects to hide behind, so long range weaponry is useless on most maps. This compounds the problem with the game I mentioned earlier; not only do you need legendary or epic items to succeed, but you need specifically short-ranged ones. It is poor game design to have over half of the most expensive weapons in the game be rendered useless by the design of the maps.",0
22181,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access Review-Disclaimer- This preview was written during Early Access. Robocraft is subject to change.-Despite the disclaimer above, Robocraft is already a pretty well oiled machine. Most of the features are working quite efficiently and the core mechanics are in place. There are plenty of things to love about Robocraft straight from go. The basic gist is you build a bot/death machine and battle it out against other peoples creations. Where the beauty of the game lies is in its creativity, from a floating pirate ship to a MechWarrior style walker, you never know what you are going to end up fighting. Robocraft is a multi-faceted game that has many layers of complexity, so I will do my best to break it all down but I may forget to mention something.The first time I loaded up Robocraft I was greeted with an anti-cheat 3rd party software. Not my favorite thing in the world but more than welcome for this type of game. Aim-bots have ruined other games and I appreciate the extra safeguard. That being said, the game does actually take quite a while to load up all of its assets. Also the game crashed right after the long load up. Not a great first impression. I credit this to Early Access hiccups and reloaded the game with little to no problems.Upon second load up, I was brought into the heart of the game, The lobby. I watched as my pre-made bot gently floated in circles and I waited. Nothing happened. What was I waiting for you ask? A tutorial or anything for that matter. Nothing came. So I began randomly clicking around. I felt dizzy and lost with the amount of buttons, however this isn't my first rodeo and especially not my first battle arena style game.After clicking around, my curiosity led me to the build mode. After a minor pop-up that explained a few buttons. I wouldn't call this a tutorial more a crash course but I digress. The builder is exceptional! It reminds me of Space Engineers where you build things in first person view and can quickly change the direction of parts with a roll of the mouse wheel. You are given some basic parts but most unlock through the games leveling system and huge branching parts tree.The way things work is that you unlock parts the more you level. You level by playing in matches and destroying other vehicles. After leveling you unlock that part for purchase. You don't get that part for free, just the ability to buy it. There are some ways around this but we will get to that later. The builder is quite extensive needless to say and a quick Google search of peoples creations is somewhat awe inspiring and impressive. Sadly my skills and blocks were inferior and building my own machine was not necessarily the best idea, not yet at least. The only problem I found was that I was very limited for the most part at the beginning of the game. The basic starting vehicles and parts work but they don't really make you feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥or all that cool. Especially as you will more then likely see other people using the same vehicle with slight variations. Things don't really become all that unique and interesting until much farther into the tech tree and amassing a fortune of in-game currency.After this, I jumped into one of the pre-made vehicles and got into battle mode. I was not disappointed at all. There are several modes and they add different objectives and themes. You have team deathmatch, a conquest type mode, and boss battle, my personal favorite. In boss battle, you and many smaller craft face off against 4 much bigger and advanced craft. This requires a great deal of team work and coordination on both teams part otherwise you end up dead very quickly. The same can be said for conquest mode, which features capture nodes that must be protected/assaulted to attain victory. In all, my experience with the battle modes was fast, visceral, and fun. Usually whoever shoots first wins but sometimes I managed to win, even if I was left heavily wounded. The only problem I found with combat was queuing up, which could take anywhere from 1 to 4 minutes per match. Which given that some matches last about the same length, was a bit much for my taste. Graphically, everything was very nice with Robocraft as well. While the focus isn't on the environments, the terrain had some nice detail and good level design, offering multiple options for different kind of play styles. The focus is for sure on the vehicles and this shows quite nicely. From the crackle of energy as your plasma cannons fire, to glowing energy panels. The only thing I felt needed a bit of work was the way you exploded which felt more like a firecracker going off than an actual explosion.The soundtrack was there. but I found it forgettable for the most part. However, I did love the sound effects. Robocraft is one of those games where you want to load up your own tunes and go to work. The options menu was rather robust with a decent amount of graphical options and rebindable keys. So let's talk about the elephant in the room, the microtransactions. Now Robocraft is not P2W or pay to win, but more like pay to skip. If you are a premium user everything is a bit easier as you earn more RP(in-game currency) and double the experience. Aside from all that, you can also purchase GC which is a premium currency that you can use to purchase most things from parts to premium status. Mind you, level still applies to this, if you aren't the right level, you can't use something ahead of everybody else in combat. Where the lynch pin lies is in the Robo shop, which allows players to purchase premade bots for real cash. This auto levels them to that particulars bots level and tier, essentially skipping the grind and getting into the good stuff. While this is far from a P2W scheme, the problem I see is that this makes the free to play aspect kinda lame. Grinding and getting up to that point is going to take you months of work where as some dude with twenty bucks did it in five seconds. Your time isn't valued here, your wallet is more important. You may be vastly more experienced in the game but getting anything done is going to be a nightmare due to queues and the way the experience system works. You are given experience based off your contribution, meaning if you have a couple of bad matches, expect zero experience.  Now one could argue that this is fair. The developer has to make money some how and development isn't cheap, also the player should be rewarded for coughing up some dough. The problem is that the free to play experience isn't as exciting.It's like going to the Zoo and seeing only the animals feet because you didn't pay. On the other side of the pay wall they have a freaking petting zoo, and you get to ride a Cheetah. Which is a damn shame because in Robocraft you probably can make an actual Cheetah, just expect to do it in weeks-months of grinding or drop a few bucks and get that shiny Cheetah right away. Everything just feels heavily stacked towards premium accounts. This shows in every aspect of the game.If you take anything from this review remember this, Robocraft is a game that requires LARGE amounts of time investment or some cash to get to the really cool stuff. The game runs well and the combat is fun but long queues and long load ups can drag the overall experience down. You can take everything I say with a grain of salt though, because the game is free to play. You have nothing to lose but time. So feel free to check the game out and make up your own opinion. Robocraft is fun and worth it alone for the boss battles and seeing the huge bots. I haven't seen many games like Robocraft, especially ones that let you have this much freedom to make whatever you want.",1
22182,Robocraft,2017.0,"This game was extremely good before the made the loot crates. Now it takes to long to get anything done in the game unless you pay real money. The creators of the game did the right thing in removing the loot crates, but the damage has already been delt. They kill there game when they implemented such a broken pay to win system, and their is no coming back from that.",0
22183,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewImagine a game where you are free to build, but it's not just some art stuff, no. Imagine a game where your building is for a purpose. The way you build determines how well your bot performs in battle and how well you take damage. You can watch your bot fall apart as you get shot and build to redirect damage in clever ways. It's great.After several updates, this important and intriguing quality of robocraft has been diminished severely and gameplay has dived as a result.",0
22184,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThis game WOULD be great.If it wasent a flakey unreliable game that is a complete money ♥♥♥♥♥.Dont get me wrong this game is incredibly fun but its mostly a pay-to-win kind of game after a certain point.  Also the launcher is very unreliable and only lets you launch the game about 50% of the time.,0
22185,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI was getting back to this game a couple of times and at each time it was different. Not worse, because I could still build my robots in peace. Now it's gone.Last and final attempt was when Maximum Loadout update came in. I don't say it was bad, to be honest it gave a player a possibility to efficiently fight against all kind of robots.But thing that finally made me think bad about this game is RP nerf. FJ agreed it was too rough and ""fixed it"".Hah, don't make me laugh. ""you’re looking at ~140 hours for 2x MegaLegs and 6x MegaLasers"" - RP Price Reductions and Time-To-BuySo I would need to play 2,5x more hours that I played to get it.It's about 43 200 000 RP = about 52 k RP for battle. As an average player before ""fix"" I took for good TDM 150 k - 200 k RP, which wasn't much. Now for same battle I take ~15 k? For great one with most kills and damage ~25 k. At lvl 98 with 25k robot!!This is a mockery. After nerf and ""fix"" most of players still get 10% of RP what they get ealier.FJ ruined the greatest thing about this game. An abillity to build everything what you can imagine without worring about money. You are making a tank, but miss 1 SMG to finish? Here, play 2-3 hours to get it.If devs wanna keep that ""fix"", they better should do something with matchmaking. The most expensive parts are only thing that will keep u alive in battle and deal real damage. Without them you will be crushed at first encounter with enemy.TL:DRGrind all evening to get one good part. ",0
22186,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewREVIEW UPDATED, SEE BOTTOM-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I used to love this game, I really did. It was my favorite for a long time. Now I am forced to stop playing because the developers are flushing it down a toilet, and I'm not a piece of sh*t so I refuse to follow it on it's downward spiral to the cesspools. If they have some convoluted plan that saves their a$$es in the end, then I may pick it up again and change my review.I've logged 350 hours in this game and now I think it's time for a review.No amount of half-arsed compensation can make up for the loss of the Mega.Sure, we can sell back all our mega-guns, but what the funk are we going to buy with all that cash? It's not like I can go and use it to build a Mega. Speaking of mega-guns, their presence is entirely useless now that we can't have enough CPU to use them.They say the Megas were too big for the maps? I never had an issue ever. If you're going to own a large vehicle, you better be skilled enough to drive it.And what's up with this new Fusion core? Another useless pile of scrap. Now that Mega bots are gone, we don't even need to worry about power consumption. And with the extreme CPU cost it has, there's no worry of having enough guns to eat all your power.One possible reason the Mega bots were removed is because whiny children were complaining due to the fact that they DON'T have a mega. It's a case of the Have-Nots attacking the Do-Haves. Also, the Store page's video is now a complete lie of false advertisement due to the removal of the Mega.The angry few are louder than the happy masses.To the Devs: Please stop smoking crack on the job. It's impairing your judgement and causing you to make horrible decisions.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------REVIEW UPDATED!The new ""Epic Loot"" update has been released! And all i can say is EPIC FAIL, FREEJAMITUPURASS. Money has been entirely done away with and replaced with an insult to your intelligence. They stole my 15 million RP and gave me 100k of this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥called ""Robits"". You don't even get paid for your missions anymore. Instead of getting 300k RP per mission like I was, I am now getting 200 RP worth of CUBES. FreeJam, there are easier ways to commit suicide other than making a hundred thousand people want you dead.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ANOTHER UPDATEWHAT THE FFFFFF IS WRONG WITH YOU MENTALLY INCAPABLE DEVS!Every update is another nail in the coffin! They keep screwing the game harder and harder! This is a SLOW PAINFUL TORTURE! I would rather be waterboarded by the chinese than have to put up with this! WHYYYYYYYYYYyyyyyy.......",0
22187,Robocraft,2015.0,"A Robocraft Anecdote: After being the first player to reach over 2.2 billion RP and the game bugging out due to it hitting the 32 bit integer ceiling for the game client (32 bit game client), The lead developer Sebastiano first accused me of cheating, and then proceeded to delete 1.2 billion of my RP as a fix, I was never compensated for this bug or loss.You can see how the developer handled it here: https://twitter.com/UncerAmbi/status/656625543102767104A Robocraft Story:In the beginning Robocraft’s fanbase were building lovers, some art some engineer.The game tought them how to fight, and they became strong. It was a free to play game loved by it's players.FJ then comes along and nerfs the physical simulator too much, making engineers rage.Developers barely play the game themselves leading to a detachment from their part on in-game balance issues.FJ buffs and nerfs in increments of 20% percent or more without any consideration for matchmaking or player skill.Test environment behaves differently than production environment so they are unable to properly test and fix long existing bugs.They add new unbalanced and unfinished gimmick features or game modes.They removed Over Tiering, but it affects Art bots as well.All cube types removed, TX cube removed then brought back only to quickly make them useless in the next update.Colours blocked behind premium paywall making the Art builder rage as well.After destroying Robocraft with their MOBA fixation they recently tried to cash grab the PUBG trend by making RoboCraft Royale and asking 15 euro for it, only to quickly make it free to play within a day. To add shame to sorrow you cannot build any robots in Royale making people wonder why it's got ""craft"" within it's name.",0
22188,Robocraft,2015.0,Early Access ReviewThe developers absolutely ruined this game.they nerfed everythingthey added a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ new moba gamemode that ruined balance in all other gamemodes and now the removed tiers.,0
22189,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI have played tons of games on robocraft.  I have played this game since it was awarded indie game of the year, and might I say props to you for accomplishing that. That said, there are a few things that need to be taken into account:Balance: The game is EXTREMELY unbalanced, the auto lock on missiles are very hard to dodge and are expensive(more on this later) and now the timer has been dropped from taking 2.5 seconds to lock on, to 2 seconds. Not only is this devastating but the main weapons of the game: plasma cannons, and plasma lasers have taken some nerfs. Lasers have reduced fire rate and plasma cannons increase power consumption. This creates a huge divide from the premium users that paid money to get the missiles easily and the basic players who can only afford one laser of a high tier.End game rewards (and money issues in general):I consider myself to not be at the end game, but close to it. My weapons have gotten quite expensive as of late. To list off a few: Top laser disintegrator: 959,549  Plasma devastator: 1,107,169 Disc Shield: 10,876,430     Blink Module: 10,507,740 Aeroflak Cannon: 11,071,688 Lock-on Missile Launcher: 10,149,047Now, this list wouldn’t be too bad, if the payoff was about 60,000~, 80,000~ with premium users in the game. Now, understandably it is frustrating that the most I can get in a game is 110,000~ with a first win of the day bonus and premium users. So, all in all you are required to play approximately 126.86~ games to acquire 1 lock-on missile launcher, let me emphasis this ONE LOCK-ON MISSILE LAUNCHER, and in order to be any use to your team, you’re going to want to pack at least 2 of them, making the amount of games you need to play skyrocket to 252~. This is unbelievable and give NO incentive whatsoever to grind out the game for the RP. I can hear it now, how can I play this game if it takes so long to get something. Easy enough, you just have to pay real life money to obtain all of these weapons, problem solved. For translation it costs you 2,300GC for 1 missile launcher, that would approximate putting $2.50(and a little more to get 50 more GC) and to get two of them you need $5.00 for it. Doesn’t seem like a lot, but this is a “FREE TO PLAY GAME” Why then would you make the game free and then choose to make the game SUCH A HUGE GRIND that you cannot even begin to reach end game content without going past a pay wall or dedicating hours upon hours to a game.Additional premium content:On a side note, I have noticed that glass now costs GC to purchase, no RP method. The three principles upon which this game is built upon is “build, drive, fight” can you drive? Yes. Can you fight? Yes, now building on the other hand. Building has been limited in the terms of glass. Glass used to be a fun cool block that you can use in your vehicle to have, which is now gone, banished behind pay wall.Things they did well at: Fun and amazing gameplay Large variety of game modes to choose from Roboshop to help you get a ship if you suck at creativity Have more than 3 bays for free Testing area Gaining RP for testing your ship against bots (although it is minuscule)I will update my review as major parts of the game are tweaked, but at the moment if given the chance to rate the game at its current state, I would give it a 4/10. This game is below average, it can perform meh compared to most free-to-play Minecraft cube copy games. However, the game still needs LARGE improvements before it can be considered a game to play.

22191,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access Reviewok i'm fully aware about what has been said negatively about this game however this game is doing what any great game has, it's trying to bring more people in and it gives a more easier system for some areas where even i was still learning (and i've played this game for about 2 years (on and off if you count the first year making three) but this game whilst having flaws like having all those nice and sweet vehicles that you have to buy to get. these vehicles however can be taken down with being smart and using smart tactics, the new tech tree system was a bit of odd one for them to implement however it does have its uses so that it makes the whole gameplay more faster (i was grinding through matches to have enough tech points for materials!) and whilst some may say that there is less amount of credits given out, i've earned more throughout matches then i have ever before! overall this game is amazing with the amount of creativity that'll satisfy the most outlandish (new word i think :D) of ideas and thinkers, this game has had its ups and downs but it is still a great game as long as you apply some knowledge to it as to counter one of these new vehicles that someone payed over $12 for. i hope the developers can see what their community puts out as to keep this game running overall.",1

22199,Robocraft,2014.0,"Early Access ReviewThis is a good game that gets some unfair negative reviews and hate.  I am going to address some unfair attacks at this game.The BIG thing about these negative steam reviews is that anybody can write them thus many Loser players with idiot tank designs come here to take out their anger on the game’s store page.  This is partly thanks to the chat window in the games main lobby where countless 9 year-olds tell the whole server why they lost because SMG’s are cheap and not because they rushed in alone with their no-armor hovercraft in between 5 enemy tanks.  When other normal players lose to an SMG tank they see the chat and believe the exaggerated comments and join them, then they start venting their anger too. The other slightly more fair reviews I’ve seen are from the old-time players who say the game devs ruined the game. I’m a little newer at this than them and I’ve played almost 40 hours of gameplay in these ""dark times,"" made it to T5 and had fun all the way, and there’s no signs of the fun stopping any time soon. The people who are having fun (and there’s a lot of us) don’t bother to write reviews, just the people who want to vent their anger do.The first thing people say is that this game is pay2win but that just isn’t true. First of all, paying users and free users get all the same parts to work with and second, in this game your robot has a stat for ranking. When you add a part to your robot it raises the rank stat and if you reach a certain point it will go up in tier. There are 10 tiers of robots and you just about always get put against robots in your tier so paying 2-win is impossible. The only thing paying does for you is give you faster progression through the tiers. Some people say its pay to progress but I’m on top of T5 and I haven’t had that problem yet although I think during a certain update it was bad but they have already fixed that by now. Progression isn’t super important anyway because by T5 every TYPE of part is unlocked, just not the bigger stronger versions (which are in there own tier). Unlike World of tanks and other F2Ps you can still make cool stuff at lower tiers and there’s none of that “premium ammo” crud that I hate.Now for the second big thing to talk about, op (over powered) weapons and parts. Every type of weapon gets called “op” 90 times in the same day because of that venting 9 year-old thing I told you about before. One big thing to keep in mind is that this game is in alpha so balance is subject to change. I hate when people say “plasma has ruined this game forever” because even if plasma was cheap the devs would rebalance it ASAP. There are only 3 different types of weapons in the game (for now) and they all have their intended functions. I’m not saying the game has always had perfect balance (and it still doesn’t) but it’s still a lot of fun to play. The last thing about balance is that a lot of players are new to this game and don’t know what they can do. An example would be that hovercrafts can dodge plasma shells vertically but I don’t see many players do this. Those players could go on to say that plasma is cheap or that hovercrafts are underpowered but the real problem is that the players don’t try new tactics.People whine a little about other things like lag, warping and glitches but I have never had those problems, those things are just more problems that people unfairly vent out during their rants.Overall I just wanted to tell you that this is a really fun game that can make you think and adapt, and also that the devs aren’t evil (I think), they gave us free stuff as makeup for a server crash they had. If the game gets big and devs finish this right then this could be a really great and solid game. Thanks for reading, PEACE OUT! ",1

22201,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewInorder to protect you I must ask that you not play this game.First I will go threw why you wouldnt or might want to anywaysand then I will go threw what the game use to be.Reasons not to play this game.1. Pay2Win because PayNot2Grind is too light of a term when grinding for one thing you want can mean playing for weeks straight or longer.2. No game balance. You will just be thrown into a game where you most likely will not be equipt.3. Based on how well you did compared to other players in the match you will be given a crate with Random parts.4. The reward crates after a match contain 90% of the 20 worst parts out of around 200.5. Selling parts gives you very little funds to buy parts.6. No useful tutorials ingame. 7. Platoons can only contain 4 members(3 without premium)8. Lack of weapon types.9. Lack of weapon balance.10. Somthings I forgot to mention.Reasons to play this game.1. You like to spend money 2 win.2. You like creating robots.3. You enjoy arena based combat.4. You like paying for premium the entire play time.Notes for the devs.1. The Epic loot update broke the game.2. There is now no balance in the game after EPIC loot update.3. Your buisness practices have become bad for players.4. We use to be able to buy what we wanted now we cant even buy what we want.we can only buy what we might want for the greatest part.,0

22211,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewGreat game! Lots of fun to be had playing this, build your own little ship, whether it drives, flies, hovers or simply crashes and dies, it's a huge amount of fun! A must try for those that like World of Tanks or similar. Of course being in Alpha means that it isn't clear of bugs and is not great on the server side at times, mainly when updates occur, but once it's working, and you get a good team together, it is brilliant! I'll continue to avoid doing more social things to play this instead.There is in-game purchases but you can't buy things, to my knowledge, which give you an advantage over free-to-play gamers. They're either to jump ahead in terms of tiers (so you can literally just start the game and buy a tier 7 robot), or they're to buy things like holoflags to place on your robots and show off. The system which you have to go through to progress through the game is cleverly done and keeps players at a reasonable pace when playing for free. I'm currently on Tier 8 but I have stuck in this Tier as this is where I find myself most comfortable with playing. You can quite easily jump back and fourth between Tiers so if a friend joins a week or two later you can go back and build one to play with them.Unfortunately Platoons (how you play with friends) is limited to 3 players, unless you buy premium then you get 4. Which seems small but works well to keep teams balanced in matches.Overall it is a fantastic start to a game which I believe will continue to grow as a community and continue to advance as it grows.",1

22216,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewJust uninstalled.I must admit, a lot of it was part of personal preference, and it was kind of sad to do so. I want to like this game. The devs can do whatever they want, but that doesn't mean I have to like what they do. Some of the ""taste"" changes have been so bizarre and unjustifiable that the game is no longer fun.A lot of people reference the removal of tiers as the beginning of the end, but I didn't mind it so much. The game wanted to change, and it was a change I was personally fine with. For me, the game ended with Epic Loot. For those who don't know, it essentially turned the typical currency-reward system into RNG loot drops at the end of each match. While I admit that it allowed the devs to remove premium items and made them obtainable by F2P peeps, it also destroyed the most important part of the game.Thanks to Epic Loot, you can forget about building what you want.I kept returning to this game over the years and have no idea why. With RNG loot, I can't build anything I want. I have half of a cosmetic mask thanks to Epic Loot, but I also have no good plane parts or heli parts. You name it, I don't have it. Everyone should at least be able to make a respectable bot in the form that they want, and everyone used to be able to do it.But now, you can't. This game is Robocraft without the craft.It gets worse. For some reason, the game devs have some sort of thing for removing gameplay. Maybe I can't find the classic elimination game mode or the protonium crystal battle arena because I'm asian, although the more likely explanation is that they got removed and replaced. There have been many other changes, such as the removal of megabots, that I can kind of understand. Some things need to be fixed, and if they need removal, so be it. Unfortunately, they haven't been replaced with anything remotely interesting, just like pretty much everything in this game over the years.This game took away the building, and it took away core gameplay over the years. In the future, this cycle will only continue and the devs have no idea when, where, or how to stop. This game is dead in my eyes. Bye.",0
22217,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFreeJam ♥♥♥♥ed up a perfectly good game.1 year ago, this game was great. The game was based on a tier progression system, depending on your robot's ranking which was decided upon the blocks used to build the robot. Starting from tier 1, to 10. That system is now long gone for more than a year. What came after that was CPU matchmaking. Based on CPU consumption on your robot, you would be put with stronger enemies. So that ♥♥♥♥ed up the game. And guess what they did after that. Yeah. You guessed it. They ♥♥♥♥ed it up even more. How? The currency used in the game called RP (along with GC, premium currency) were both eradicated. Instead came a lousy universal currency called Robits. So how do you get Robits? You don't. Before, you would earn credits based on your game performance, good games could earn you lots of RP, which were then turned into Robits (divided by 10 or 100 or 1000) after the update. If you didn't have much RP before the update, the game simply would laugh at you in the future. So guess what they did. They introduced a loot system. Instead of spending your hard earned money how you want to, now, based on game performance, you get crates which reveal loot (NOT money) which can mostly be♥♥♥♥♥♥because you need to be extremely lucky to get something rare, so do get something rare you need to sell items so that you can get robits but selling items for robits gives something like 50-1000 robits so in each game unless you get a Platinum chest you get 50-1000 robits and rare items can cost up to 150,000 robits! WHAT?! DO THEY REALLY THINK THAT'S GOOD? So let's list some Pros and ConsPros:-Creativity, now limited.-...Nothing elseCons:-Lousy server-Horrible loot system-Terrible dev team-Overpriced items-Time taking grind marathon-Items that cost WAY too much and are not good whatsoever (remember the Aeroflak? anyone?)-Playerbase that is made of absolute Toxic Waste gathered from Chernobyl, assembled in a laboratory and ♥♥♥♥♥ed upon-FJ Guard dogs-Tons of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥terryTL;DR: This game is worse than killing yourself.

22218,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewJust any other Free to Play game, you should pick this up for an hour and give it an open-minded go.In this game you build a tiny vehicle (I say vehicle, because robots do not require a pilot, because it is esstentially it's own pilot, but vehiclecraft doesn't sound as good, so I'll call it a robo) and then fight using it against other players who have built their own robot.You can build whatever you want. If you have the parts, it can be made. I've seen people make literal spider walkers (are usually seen in challenge mode or late into the game, like 80% into it), an smg car shaped like a person, a heavily armored box car, a car only describable as a quad from dune 2000, even a flying♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that one time.You can make jets, hovercrafts, ""drones"", actual drones, helicopters, tanks, cars, and you can get to the end of the game's current progression to make gigantic versions of these where you can either pit it against tons of smaller, weaker enemies, or fight in a battle filled with giant robos!I have only gotten 27% into the game, Tier 3, but already I can make hovercraft, cars, tanks, hybrids of either of those and stuff.There are indeed weapons, and they all have their own uses and strengths and ways of using them. Indeed, this isn't call of Duty where tons of weapons exist, but all of them in a category all work basically the same.You've got 4 weapons. SMGs, Plasma Cannons, Railguns, and Nanotech Disruptor which heal allies and deals damage to enemies in a straight beam.The game abides by physics most of the time, so if your robo is not properly made, then you can expect to find problems, luckily there IS a practice mode that has no penalty or reward, filled with enemies you can test your robo against, some of them potentially player-made (THAT NEEDS TO BE A THING IF NOT! <3)This game is fun, just... don't get discouraged if some turd with a railgun goes into Tiers 1, 2 or 3. It happens a decent amount even though Tier 5 really should be a cut-off point for tech being below the tier it was meant for (Aka railguns below Tier 4 battles, or Helicopters below Tier 5. Walkers below Tier 7 isn't much of a big deal honestly because they're cool to the point I wished there was a Tier 4 version of them).you won't be able to make the robo you want to from the get-go (I personally have an obsession for walkers, sometimes bordering on fetish-territory if you throw on some missile launchers and beam cannons onto it xD).The only real downside to the game is the inability to mix and match weapon types. I suppose it helps for balance reasons, but it'd be cool if you could have two weapons at a time. Though then you could have medic guns on railgun planes, which would be a tad unfair.Each different item has its purpose and use, th only thing that is really much of an exception are the blocks, but they are instrumental in being tough to destroy as without them... well you're not tough to destroy as the original blocks are free for a reason.Spoiler: They're garbage above Tier 1.There's also Electro plates, which are indeed shield technology, but the precursor to it.Feel free to download this game and give it a try, it's really quite fun! Personally building the robo is my favorite part, let alone actually using it, which is even better.It's really fun.I also give this game a 6/10, which says alot for it's current state. There's not alot of bugs left and the devs have taken time and actually tried in their endeavor to make a great game which has probably very little content in comparison to the finished result, and 0 bugs or glitches pretty much.PS: This game has support for us OCD buggers who have to symmetry everything in the mirror mode.

22221,Robocraft,2018.0,"It used to be good. Now it turned into extremely unballanced, rage-inducing, crate-opening pay to win game.A huge tank with lots of weapons and shields can be easily taken out by a tiny drone that was lucky enough to unbox an epic missile launcher. And don't even think about flying higher than 5 meters; the game has many ways to counter aircraft, however there is no way for the aircraft themselves to counter ground attacks. There is no way to deflect an incomming missile, no way to jam enemy radars (which also are not a thing anymore).All the screenshots are nice, but do not expect to see anything like that in the game itself. The most efficient way to play is to just create a wide gunbed and mindlessly throw guns at it.Yes of course there are special devices like the ghost module or the jump drive or whatever is it called, but those will not help you because 95% of your opponents will just be spraying area damage all over the place.I haven't played this game a lot, but I have experienced all of it in last couple years, and I can say that it is one of those rare early access games that started with a great and complex gameplay, only to get over-simplyfied and spoiled by people willing to pay money for easier gameplay. Just look at flying; it used to be difficult to build an airplane, you had to put engines on without throwing the balance off, now you don't need engines at all, the wings have in-built hover thrusters. Getting in the air is just a matter of holding spacebar on a single spot.Before, you had to have radar on your robot that would help you locate enemies, you could share your radar coverage with allies using network relays, you could have radar jammers that would make you invisible to enemies with weaker radars, you could play with no weapons only as a scout or a stealth recon aircraft.Now - all that is gone. No radars, no jammers, no relays.There were only three main weapon types; SMGs with low damage but relatively fast firing speed for close-range combat, plasma cannons with high damage output, low fire rate and with artillery projectiles for medium range, and laser rifles for long range combat. You had to find balance between these weapons and you had to learn how to use them properly.Now all you need are flaks with high damage, high fire rate and long range, or missiles that lock on and can't be countered at all.Would I recommend it? Only if you have enough spare money to spend on crates or enough patience to keep dying (or rich parents, ya never know)",0

22223,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI used to love this game. I had a lot of great expereinces, and today I hopped on again to have some more fun, but what I found shocked me. Lots of features I loved were gone. The new item system was just awful, and all bots felt extremely fragile. The need for a chair was removed, which is extremely disapointing as now bots dont have a weak point you have to stratigicly place. healing ruins the game, and the old gamemode, which was awesome and required stratigy and skill was completely removed. In the new item system, getting parts feels like a massive grind, and its just no fun. i spent hundreds of (forgets what money is called) on armor, and then all armor is removed. Even if you do like it as it is now, dont trust the devs to keep it, as they frequently seem to change the game entirely. the worst part is now they push the membership even more than it allready was. Want a bot thats not white, grey, orange, or blue? Give us money. Want the grinding halved? give us money.I also found that my extremely expensive bot I sold my other two bots for now was basicly worthless, and that I will have to basicly start over.Will I keep playing? Sure. But in the way I play pokemon now. not because i enjoy it, but because im trying to squeeze out a time beet of delicous nostalga juice.",0

22225,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewTLDR; Check back in a month. Loot system doesn't reward. Game is ludicrously grindy.Played since release (pre-steam). Game was always grindy. But now it's worst than a Korean MMORPG. You get these crates, which contain from 1 to 4 items depending on the mode you played. If you're premium, you get twice an many items. Items now have a rarity, with the coolest being legendary, and the essentials being white/rare/epic.The concept is cool, but the items you get are essentially garbage. Let's say you have premium, and you open a Protonium crate you earned from acheveing top place in Battle Arena (which is like 30 minutes). A sample crate would be (after the ""fix"" patch), 7 green items and 1 blue item. Doesn't sound bad right? A♥♥♥♥♥♥hover, 20x triangle cubes, 20x window cubes (thats your rare), a single wheel, 20x corner cubes, a bottom left corner ""mask"" cosmetic, the flag of poland, and a♥♥♥♥♥♥rudder.As a new player, you can't make much out of that. You can upgrade your existing robot, but only to a certain point. As a played with an OK stock of basic items and a working robot (my situation), you can't do anything with that. And as a veterant player, it's all garbage.Problem is the distribution of items in the top tier crate, Protonium, is something like 10% white, 60% green, 20% rare/blue, 10% epic, 0% legendary.And amongst the item pool are ""cosmetic"" items. Masks, window blocks, flags.And you only get 1 item of each. Except cubes, you get 20 of those.So unless your idea of a robot is a handful of blocks with a wheel, a hover and a thruster, and a single gun, this game will make you work very hard to get a working ""set"" of items. Even more so if you want to upgrade from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tier.It's just not fun, the rewards aren't rewarding and they aren't coherent. There is this recycle/forge system, but right now you get 20% of the value of the item. So if you take all the items from that Protonium crate, you can melt them down and craft 1 or 2♥♥♥♥♥♥tier SMGs (you need like 9 to be effective). At 400 ""robits"" each. Let's say you want to craft that Flak cannon that guy blew you up with over and over in the last match. 75000 robits. That shotgun-like thing that other guy blew half you bot off in one hit with. 122500 robits. Thats a lot of crates. Like 300. 300 premium, top-place victories in Battle Arena, the longest match mode. If you lose you get the Bronze crate regardless of your performance.A positive point in all this, is that the crate tiers seem to not matter! So you can just practically idle, lose the game, and get your 8-item Bronze crate, and progress as fast as that other guy with his carefully crafted bot and hard earned victory that's getting Protonium crates.Check back in a month.",0

22231,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewYou can see that i spent one hour in the game, but i only gave this game the final shot before writing this review and unfortunately for this game, it took this long to get into single battle.I started to play it in late 2014 using robocraft launcher and managed to reach t7 in 3-4 days or so. Queue times were short and battles were fun, though the more i progressed the more cheaters i saw. It was the main problem those days. Developers tried to make authoritative server to solve the issue, but failed at that (because of obvious reason) and chosen EasyAntiCheat. Since it is client thing, it did not filter all the cheaters, and caused issues for many fair players because of how it is designed. After a while they decided to push another update, where they removed repair cost completely. Many players liked it, but mostly those who couldn't build a proper robot and those who often leave the battle in the middle of the game.In another huge update they changed the default game mode, that was a mistake once again, because new game mode was bugged and each round took a lot of time, making the players both play with half a team (because of explained above reason) and wait much longer between rounds.Of course there were some good updates and things too, like megabots and medics, but they cant overweight the bad ones.I stopped to play this game because it is very choppy. Seriously, i posted bug reports related to this several times almost a 8-9 months ago and it is still not fixed. Last time i even explained solution to this and that fact is ridiculous.Currently it is 3 months since unity 5.1 (including beta) is out. And it has authoritative server functionality built in. Guess what? They keep using EAC s*** instead of it. They created some vacancies on their site because they cant fix their game on their own.

The entire game has changed for the worst, and here's why:- The majority of in-game content (INCLUDING HALF OF WHAT YOU GET OUT OF CHESTS) requires a membership you have to pay for ($49.99 for lifetime)- There's an in-game currency now (Robobits, I think?) that you also have to pay for to get any significant amount. There's a system which lets you ""Recycle"" parts that you're not using for more bits, BUT it utterly destroys the value of the parts, so you don't get nearly as many bits as you should. If you get Premium, you get 3x the amount of bits out of parts.- The game is MASSIVELY pay-to-win. Worse than it was before. Since I played in Alpha, I had ~25 chests to open, and got enough bits to buy a tank build off of the factory. This is pretty much where players can upload their builds and other players can buy them with bits. Well, I bought the tank, went into a game, and literally no one could kill me. I went 14-0 and 9-0 in both games that I played. I felt really bad because it's very unfair to other players, I didn't expect it to be that busted.- The graphics in the menu itself seem to have gone in reverse as far as progress goes. The ship that displays your builds was replaced with a grey texture everywhere, even on Fantastic graphic settings. If you go into build mode, the room goes back to its original texture, but it's very choppy sometimes? I know it isn't my computer causing the lag, I get great framerates everywhere else, but sometimes in build mode, it jumps around a TON for awhile.Honestly, the game went from being something decent with its tier unlock system and general theme it had going on, to seeming very greedy while also cutting back the quality of the graphics nearly everywhere. Even the cut scene when you launch the game looks like it's a 240p video.RIP Robocraft.",0
22235,Robocraft,2017.0,"An absolute shadow if its past.Gutted and butchered to shove in horrible microtransactions. Imbalanced matches where you will fight bots 3-4x more powerful than yours in every match. The old elimination style mode thrown out in favor of an auto regen deathmatch with infinite spawns.It's an absolute shame such a fun and unique game turned in to such a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I really wanted to get back into this but it's just impossible.

22236,Robocraft,2017.0,"TLDR: as almost all reviews suggest, game was better back pre-mid 2015. Bad decisions have killed the game for much of its former playerbase, if you are thinking about playing the game. Don't, it's simply not worth it.Simple, developers killed what was core to the game. Skill is now second to luck, as creation in the game is limited by lootboxes (an incredible mark of poor judgement). Better when the game had an honourable tech tree system that allow players to choose a particular path they wanted to go. Honestly robocraft is now a shriveled burnt corpse of its former self, It used to reward you for being both a good builder, and a good player. Not because you managed to get lucky in a loot system that is completely random and out of place. I would happily reccomend this game to people in 2014 (when it received indie game of the year award) and early 2015 during the megabot update. As it was what I had been searching for in a game for what seemed like forever, a team based building game that would reward the skill of the builder and the player. I have no idea what they were thinking when they introduced a clan system, lootboxes and non specialised robots. Why? If the Devs decide to revert some of the changes, I assume many people including myself would flock back to the game. Freejam killed their success.",0
22237,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewWas a fun game some time ago, now it's pay-to-win. They also changed gameplay a lot and removed many cool features. Wouldn't play now even without all those paywalls.",0
22238,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewLast patch removed the tech tree and gave previously lower tech weapon tiers some benefits over their higher tier counterparts. This was good. Now new players have access to flight components.They also removed the 100% return on sold items, nerfed it to 20%, and switched from currency per match, based on how much you got done, to giving you random parts.  This was...horrible. Now new players can stare at those flight components and know that its hundreds of hours of playtime to get them. Also, where before they'd have been able to experiment with all unlocked tech freely (due to 100% refund on parts), now they lose 80% of their progress if they sell pieces. Meanwhile, those of us who already had decent block stockpiles are rocking highly cost efficient robots to smack down noobs with. That enemy missile launcher you're having trouble with? You can have that, just play a few thousand matches. That's not hyperbole. It costs 137.5k robits, which is 687.5k worth of sold parts. A match might give you a couple hundred robits worth of parts, if you are lucky. Thousands of matches, and when you've done it, you have that one part - not open access ot it and all lower tiers, just that one part. Want to try a sniper helicopter, or a gun sled, or a bomber? That's a whole new grind, or you can toss 80% of your effort out the window and sell your shiny missile launcher.The old grind is gone. The new grind is worse.",0

22240,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewWhat is even this game anymore?So I haven’t played rotorcraft since the flipper got removed, back then this game was great. Being able to create anything you wanted and the how the game was tiered and balanced was a great idea. So I recently reopened the game and was greeted by a loot box icon, originally thinking that this was a bonus item. So then I played the game mode 'team death match"" because it is the only game mode I know how to play. Once the game had finished I did not earn any money. Confused, I looked up why and apparently you actually have to buy items to make your robot unlike before where you could literally play this game for free. Robocraft is no longer a free to play game. It is impossible for a new player to get in to this game without dropping ridicules sums of money.  With disappointment one of my most favourite games I can no longue enjoy because the developers have decided to strip any enjoyment out of the game. Just to make a few extra bucks... ",0

22244,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access Reviewso i started playing this game on the 24th of april 2016. it was great. the robot ranks ensured i only fought against people in a similer level to me and it was fun. there was a pay to win element but it was mostly unintrusive as you earned money from battling which you could use to buy the the things you wanted for you bot from a store. It WAS good. sadly this is not the case any more.as of todays 28th of april patch the only reliable way to obtain the items you want is to pay for currency and buy them, instead of being awaded cash to buy items at the end of a round you are now given crates on completetion of a battle which contain random mostly crappy items. there is no more robot ranking and you will quite often be matched with people that are so far beyond your level that you might aswell just not respawn. you can still buy the things you want for you bot . but to get the money to do that you have to scrap the random crappy parts that it gives you from crates, but the scrap value of those parts is so low as to be almost not even worth it. really the only way to reliably obtain a specific item now is to pay RL money for a bunch of high end crates so you can scrap them for the money to buy the thing you want.

22245,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewA year and a half ago and I would of thoroughly recommended this game. But after recent updates my opinions towards this game have changed drastically. With an almost entirely new combat system now allowing bots to have more than one weapon type which completely breaks the nature of the game. I like the idea of free loot etc after a game to ease the process of getting items for your bot however the removal of the tech tree with the tier stars was a bump downhill and really where my dislike for the game happened. I could go on for much longer but I fear I would bore those of you reading this review so I will put it nice and clear at the end here for you.DON'T PLAY THE GAME THEY TURNED IT INTO A LOAD OF♥♥♥♥♥♥,0
22246,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewDon't let the 115 hours on record fool you. I've played this game for many hundreds of hours and enjoyed every minute of it. that is until the ""epic loot update"" which effectively removed everything fun about the game. robocraft used to allow players to save the ingame currency and work towards what they wanted. now all you can do is wish for luck in an endless grind likened best to gambling for hours with no return. this loot system is the only way to get ingame items and that being said you can never get what you want. do you have an idea for a great robot that you want to test? tough luck you'll have to hope that the Freejam Overlords look favorable upon you so you may or may not get the gear to make your bot. Don't get the wrong Idea i don't hate the game or the loot system. The problem is the ingame currency was removed meaning you cant get what you want anymore. This stunts creativity and disables one's ability to make the robots they want to. until the Epic loot system is removed and or Freejam restores the ingame currency I can not recommend this game to anyone and i will certainly not be spending my money on a company that doesn't care about its player base.Edit 1: it has come to my attention that Freejam is working to remove the Epic loot system and restore teirs as well as removing the boost system!

22250,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewWell, here I am. This was my favorite game, played for hours a day, and thought about it through school. Now? I hate clicking the play button. This went from GREAT! to Meh... to BURN IT WITH FIRE!!!!!!! I must say, I was happy when the game updated, but then when the release came out for new items, it would be A) To... bloody... expensive... B) The high teir ""pro's"" can only get it. And don't even get started on the economy. WAY back then, it was great! Smooth economy, things can be affordable with 2-5 battles, and getting good was at the good point, where its hard and takes work, but then when you get their, you feel rewarded. Now? The lower teir's must be facedesking themselves with how greedy these people are. What happens? Every update, it feels like the prices grew higher and the ""money"" earned went down or didn't go as high as the prices did. I spent weeks trying to get THREEEEE MEGA HOVERS, WEEKS! WEEKS! FOR CCRYING OUT LOUD! WEEKS! ""To make it a challenge"" said the mods+, such a challenge to get them, it took me a shorter time to get through T7 (The hardest teir for me to get through) than to get 3 bloody Mega Hovers. Back to updates, it was easy to get into updates and other things related to Robocraft. ""New update coming soon!"" ""YAY!"" I would think. As it went on and on, it was ""New update with new weapons and a new map!"" First time in for a new map in a LOOONNNGGG time. What was I like? ""Meh"". VERY unexcited. Removing ernable cash from battles (without selling) was Robocraft shooting itself in the leg thats bleeding like hell from the other times it shot itself in the leg and never fixed it. I liked the crates idea at first, but when I saw that the upper row requires premium to get those items?  I had a brain fart. Another thing to add onto the list of greedy things Freejam has done. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I never knew how much nerfing Freejam would do to weapons that weren't one of the ""newer"" weapons. Newer weapons such as the Missile Launcher, Anti Air, Proton Launcher, and things that came after that. To make it not any longer, I just want to say, this game WAS once good, but now? It has gone down the drain. I feel like it can no longer be saved. I guess it can't be saved.Goodbye, Robocraft, our times once were fun, and enjoyable.     ~Billybobjoe",0

22254,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewHello! This is my review of ROBOCRAFT I am very expirenced in this game I have over 2000 hours :p (Yes for a while I did forget about a life) I have been playing since 2014 near launch back then it was a very fun game and no P2W at all. Yes their was grinding but not as much now. I personally prefer the old system for money it was better than haveing to grind for crappy crates. I think things went downhill after the META update the crates got added they changed alot of stuff and messed up the game and such. But as you can see much of the community has the same views as me so im going to have to say no to this game but as always it is up to you if you like the game. :),0
22255,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI played this game about a year back (i stopped shortly after they released legs) And came back now to see what happened to the game in the meantime. For someone who really enjoyed how the game used to work, it's a big disappointment now. The removal of blocks with different durabilities might have been a defendable change, since some might argue that it turned the game into a bit of a grind, but replacing it with a system built on loot crates with random contents and weapons as different rarity drops makes no sense in this kind of game. The ""healing"" of damage dealt to your robot (at least in the gamemodes where you can actually find a game in a reasonable time) might be nice if it happens to you, but is utterly frustrating when a fast enemy just escapes from your view to return unharmed a few seconds later. For me the fun in the early stages of robocraft was in building a robot with multiple propulsion systems and failsafes to make sure i can still fight after taking damage, it was in batteling a crippeled enemy while trying to angle my weapon with my one remaining leg. Of cause it takes away waiting time from the game, but the cost is a lot of what made robocraft unique.It seems like someone decided to take the regeneration of a modern shooter (without taking into account how little sense that makes for robots), the lootcrate system of Overwatch (with the difference that the crates actually contain stuff that changes the gameplay, making it almost pay to win) and the slow progression of Warframe (which is worse since the game is PvP not PvE so the loadout actually matters).I can see how players like some of these changes and i can see how players that played a lot and dont mind to spend some money from time to time will still enjoy the game, but i would not pick it up as a new player, there are better f2p games out there and i would not come back to it if you enjoyed it when it first started. I uninstalled it again; it's a shame, i really enjoyed the original robocraft.",0
22256,Robocraft,2018.0,i personally use to love robocraft it was a game that was perfect (i mean who doesent love building robots then going to the battle field) but then they removed the tech tree and currency to buy block/guns take ages to get.The lootbox is nice but it takes ages to get a legendary and then it lands in premium slots-Devs change the game to how it use to be#MakeRobocraftGreatAgainEdit:This Review will be changed to + once they reverd the changes in the newest update,0

22258,Robocraft,2018.0,"Long time ago that was a brilliant game i played with a pleasure. Then you, FreeJam, just erased your game. All the staff your game was good at just had been DELETED. Tier system has gone(that was great, why did you got rid of it?) Then armor(What was wrong with that? just tell!) Then tech tree get symplified(just a one straight line that every dumb could understand how to use it) Then you got rid of that at all and added damned crates! On this point I had left the game, so it was dead for me. Now I am back to see what changed through the years. And what I see? You deleted classic deathmatch mode!(ONLY good staff that was in the game after crates added) That new gamemodes are just arcade: autoheal and respawn kills all team tactical apects. So the game named ""Robocraft"" is actually dead. That product having this name is just boring pay-to-win arcade game that i don't recommend you to play at all. At least now.

22259,Robocraft,2016.0,"This game is a fine example of wasted potential.Everything was fine in the early years, there was variety, there was fairness, there was a GOOD F**KIN GAME. Then they started adding updates that raised a whole lot of suspicion. Firstly, they removed tier 1 wings, balloons, and other types of flight modules. I can only assume they wanted to make sure players understood the game a wee bit better before they went super complicated, but its more likely that they wanted to suck money out of all the people who lost their flying vehicles by paying to get to the stuff they used to have. Over time, the game got worse and worse, player outrage followed, it was only a matter of time before IT happened. and then IT happened, the loot box update, this update ditched the Tech tree for parts in favor of a loot box system that was worse than the tech tree in almost every single way. Player riots followed, protests, petitions, etc. Newbie and Veteran players alike left en masse as the game was now a hollow shell of what it once was. I stayed behind, hoping that they would return to the old ways. I was wrong, the curency system was changed, you were given rewards base on performance (Ie. the better you do, the better your reward) This created a strong sense of Teamwork and assistance between others. Over the course of 1 update, that was gone. I've played video games ever since I was 3 years old, I can remember the first game I ever played (Crash Bandicoot 2 on the PS1) and ive seen some of the best of the best (Ie. Super mario Galaxy) and the lowest of the low (Stuff like The Slaughtering Grounds by Digital Homicide LLC). I went from casual to regular to Hardcore Gamer over the years. I play to win and to have a damn good time doing so. I dont play to get an RNG chest and get worthless crap that is only there to make me even more annoyed than I should be.

22261,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewAfter about 180 hours of enjoying this game on and off (and realizing that the good parts are impossible to grind for), I thought it would be a good idea to put some money into the game, as much as a full prized game actually, to finally get more out of it.I enjoyed the components the RNG gave me for my money, but very short time after there was a server-error that caused me to lose items.Having put money into the game this was really offputting, but it would have been bearable if there were any support.But after multiple support requests and also making a forum thread in the official forum, there happened nothing.So my verdict is: Enjoyable game if you don't mind never getting the good components, but DON'T put any money into it until it's a stable game.

They've added too many anti-aircraft weapons, so now its not even fun to be airborn at all. Not to mention the only way to get new items in the game is to sell old ones, which was one of the LEAST EFFICIENT ways of earning GC in previous updates.On top of all this, the most popular players of this game have stopped playig as well, if that doesn't say anything, then I don't know what does.Its unfortunate, if you like building vehicles and not really having to worry about its strength or any skill, then this game is for you...<Edit>I came back to the game the other day, tried to build a bot just to see how the game is going, but the ""average wait time of 22 seconds"" was total BS, I couldn't get into a match.Congratulations FreeJam, looks like you screwed up your game so badly that no one wants to play anymore.",0

Simply awful.1)  You create based on what you've tested and played thus far, then they pull the rug out from under your creation by making significant game-swaying changes seemingly without having done much testing/balancing of their own.  Any fun you have putting energy/thought/creativity/TIME into your robot is suddenly turned into twice as much frustration because they change the rules of the world/game upon which you based your creation.2)  Team ""matching"" is entirely random or non-existent.  Rare is the match where the teams are even.  One game you dominate and feel like king of the world only to be slapped senseless in your next match.  How about checking some numbers before throwing together two teams?3)  Pretty sure they have no idea what to do with mega-robots.  All these cool huge scale robot late-game items that you figure out after-the-fact can't be used like the robots you played with up to that point.

22270,Robocraft,2018.0,"This game plain and simple betrayed my trust. What do i mean by that? I picked up robocraft a while ago, back in the days before there were walking mechs, when there was a tech tree and i coudl feel myself progressing in the game. I spent real money to gain access to a part i wanted to use, and gain access to one of the premium robos that came with that purchase, again this was way back in the day, When it was all about building and protecting your captains chair, making something unique that worked, I had made myself a hovering ship in the same style as the floating ships in a mario game. THEN The Devs had an update. Not only did the update remove all of my progress thusfar, it removed my robos and my premium ship that i paid real money to have and have access to, I lost everythign when it updated but i decided to give it another chance and rebuild from the ground up. This was the begining of a slippery slope of removal of progress, updates that drastically altered the game. and finally, the death of what i thought was a unique and wonderful experience. I played world of tanks for a long time, about two years total before i picked up robocraft, and the game felt more rewarding and interesting than both World of Tanks and Warthunder, despite being in the same genre of game. Now the game is a husk of the creativity and interesting gameplay. If you wanted to pick up robocraft now. I couldn't reccomend it if you payed me. It doesn't feel like you are making progress. It doesn't feel like you can be successful with your own creation. ANd worst of all. It doesn't feel fun.If the devs ever decide to make a seperate game that is more of the classic robocraft I would love to play it, even pay for the experience of that again. This game isn't gonna go out with a bang, or with a graceful defeat in the likes of paragon. The game will wither. and that is a crime",0
22271,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game used to be amazing. It was perfect. i stopped playing it for a while and recently came back to it. and i have to say, THEY COMPLETELY FREAKING RUINED IT!!! I swear they took EVERY SINGLE good part out of the game. And now, it is completely pay to win. Great job Idiots. you ruined a perfectly normal game.",0
22272,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewSo, as a long time player with quite a handful of playtime on hand. Who never wished to review such a game so early in development. The update, frankly, ruins the games base mechanics. As a new player, you will encounter a range of other players, who are, to frankly. To strong to play against, as the new looting system hands out Flak cannons and Missle Launchers like a closing down sale at the local walmart. The base of creatvity was simply yanked away from under the long time players feet, leaving them with this under constructed mess of luck, and, who has access to mama's bank account. But, I believe you are reading to understand why I give this game a blood red thumbs down.- The ability of skill needed to construct a good robot for battles, has been removed, only those lucky enough to grab the good loot will survive, and do well in battle. Turning the game into a playmobile playset.- The whole gun balance scheme, whilst creative, removed the core of the game. Logging on to level up, grind, unlocking new goods and parts for your bot as you progressed through the ""Ranks"" and ""Tiers"" was utterly satisfying. But now, as I like to state in bold letters. now depends on LUCK.- Going down a payment scheme system, if you are a end game player who depends on the bulky, stronger movement types and weapons. The chances of you getting enough ""End Game"" Tank treads, let us say, x4 of them to craft a large track robot, would take an incredible amount of time, you either win battles and unlock a tiny payload, or, put some cash into the game and pray to Uncle Gabe that the holy angels bestow their fine blessings, as you unlock the purple crates of  luck. When as before, you could fight for in game credits, and simply purchase what you need. - Let us say this whole new unlocking scheme got adjusted. Recycling is still an issue if you ever wish to craft items. With a tiny percentage of currency returning to you as you scrap worthless items, it is a grind itself to simply craft a basic SMG.- Like most small companys, money is important, and most fall to their need of greed, but, this is my opinion.Minor ""Perks""- Single player is still open, meaning if you wish, just play robocraft by yourself on the odd hour. Make a robot and mess around, without the stress of low level flaks shooting you up the rear- Still hosts ""Some"" kind of creativity.- This update introduced me to Crossout. The new, improved Robocraft.",0
22273,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewGood idea on paper - but so was communism. Developers live in a fantasy world, and only listen to daily player login counts instead of actual constructed feedback from its community.",0
22274,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewI can no longer say I enjoy this game. The developers update it much too fast and take too many of the features we liked from the game, adding new ones that made it unenjoyable. Unless they decide to revert it back to an earlier version, or at least remove some of these godawful new features, I can not recommend this game.",0
22275,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access Review--2/14/2017--Came back to check the game out, see what's changed, put a few more hours in. Absolutely garbage. I wish I could give an even worse recommendation than 'no'. The game isn't fun. Making new or more interesting bots is now more difficult than ever.It may not be 'pay to win', but it sure as hell is 'pay to have fun'. This game isn't worth your time anymore.They now have a brawl mode, which mixes up how the game is normally played, bans certain parts, changes certain balancing in the game. It's attrocious. It's poorly thought out, poorly implemented, and just makes it clear exactly how incompetent the devs are.Stay away from this game.-----------------------------Well, FJ hasn't done anything about income as of yet, and just the past Thursday (June 16, 2016) they release a major patch with no changes to income. I think I will be officially and permanently calling it quits for this game. I haven't played  for weeks now, and have no intention of reinstalling anytime soon.----Old Review----(I'll change this review when it's worth changing)Hate the new crate system. If FreeJam wanted to reduce income, then reduce income. Instead of cutting the amount earned from a battle by 10% or 50% or what ever they wanted, they instead decided to slash income to near 0%. Want to build a sick double IND hover? Sorry, you'll either have to spend money, or sell nerly every valuable item you have. Alternatively you can say ♥♥♥♥ it. Not build that sweet hover, and instead hope that in the next month, you'll get two legendary drops for that component.I have no idea what the actual drop percentage for an IND is, but is seems to be something of the order 1 in 10000 crates. Meaning your chance of getting two IND is as likely as being attacked by a shark. I have only gotten 3 legendaries since the update. At the time of posting this, it's been over five weeks since the epic loot update. I play semi-regularly. In other words, don't hold your breath. If you want a good bot, you have to spend money. End of story. Oh, almost forgot: I've had premium since the epic loot update dropped. Meaning I'm twice as likely to get a legendary from a crate. If you are a non-premium player, expect this to take twice as long.",0

I forgot about it :) Anyways, the game is fun because you get to build a robot and shoot other robots. From what I gather from other reviews, it has a pay to play feature which I highly dislike. It takes a ton of time to get anywhere and you're paired with random people not at all in your skillset compared to what you've built/unlocked.

22281,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game used to be great and unique, and now they destroyed that.There was so much strategy brought about by protecting your pilot seat, suddenly they removed that.The tier system worked great as a reward system, that went out the window.The shop was consistent and straightforward, they had to screw that up as well.The new legs added are too simple and make me feel like I'm playing an old bad mech game.Team Death Match makes me feel like I'm playing something like Call of Duty.The ability to heal without returning to base makes me less worried about building a functional robot all around, and more focused on just shooting everything around me knowing I'll be able to heal.These changes were horrible and overall make me not want to stick around anymore.I mean, they even screwed up the UI, how do you go from good to terrible like that?",0
22282,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewFree-Jam you've turned a BIG WINNER into a HUGE LOSER.  This game was a HUUUUGE game.  It...was HUUUGE.  I really used to love it.  I played all the time, spent real money from time to time on premium, enjoyed playing at any tier level with the blocks I accumulated through playing the game simply for fun.I used to encourage new players to FIGHT MORE and TALK LESS in chat when they worried about having to accumulate points to spend on the tech tree in order to access more powerful weapons and blocks to tier up....fighing and gaining access to higher tier gear was fun.  Well, that is ALL GONE now.  I don't understand the decisions made by Free Jam to turn this once wonderful game into what it is now - which is NOT FUN.  I liked designing my own bots - why did you devote so much energy into pushing players towards buying other peoples designs?  Who needs that?  I liked fighting and earning points to buy gear, what is this insanity you have now?  If i wanted to earn points fast I would pay for premium, the lottery loot drop system makes that a doubtful investment now.  Are you really making more money with all the new garbage you guys are doing?  Was the old approach really not profitable?  You used to be able to get me to fork over cash for premium but now I am not enticed at all. You blew it Free-Jam, i miss Robocraft from a year+ ago.  ",0
22283,Robocraft,2016.0,Early Access ReviewObviously with reading the reveiws you can see that FreeJam took a good game and ruined it to make it a terrible badly made pay-to-win game. It's true. But it's free. Whadaya expect? If it costed money. They'd make no money. (They don't deserve being on steam.),0
22284,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewTo anyone considering this game, sorry but you missed the window of when it was good.  Ultimately the point of a game is to have fun and right now it is not fun.  It used to be fun to build, fun to play, even sometimes fun to lose.  However the last half year have been stripping this away, and now after the past couple of months it is no longer fun even to win a game.  When winning, losing, and building are all a chore and not fun, it is a sign that the game has failed in the very mission.I have been playing this game for over 1000 hours counting the stand alone launcher.  I started back when it first went on steam, and although I wish I could give it a good review, at this point I simply can't.The Developers had a fantastic game, that needed a few tweaks, a little balancing, and some bug fixes but was otherwise really good.  Then starting around November 2015 they began doing major updates that completely broke multiple aspects of the game.  These updates came about more and more often.  Worst of all they completely changed the direction that the game had been going.Thus veterans such as myself who fell in love with game X and were excitedly waiting its finished product, instead now have Game Y and dread its completion.I tried to keep playing, but they just keep making it more difficult to stick with it.  Everything feels gimmicky and very much like a smartphone app game.  Balance is worse than ever, and long time elements of the game were broken.  Ultimately it feels like the game is intending to drive away veteran players in favor of casuals.Very sad to say, but at this point I shall no longer be playing, except to test periodically and see if the game has been fixed to the greatness where it once was.  Barring that I just can't seem to bring myself to even finish a round.",0

You were able to unlock different tier weapontry, parts, and blocks and there was so much diversity with the game. After the lootcrate update the game was ruined. Everyone lost all thier parts and weapons, and the diversity of parts is so much smaller now. I lost all of my robots, most of my parts, all of my blocks, and was forced to start from scratch. I dont know what the devs were thinking with it, but this game is ruined and there is nothing really anyone can do realistically other than reverting back to the old tiering system. In fact that is the only thing they can do to save this game now. All I can say is I'm disappointed in everyone involved in the making of this game.

22293,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game was awesome up until recently. Back in the day people actually used their creativity, but now they just build a hovering cube with a shotgun or two and a cloak.... Needless to say that this isn't any fun for the veterans that actually enjoy playing the game.The new ""epic loot"" system is utterly and royally stupid. You have a ""chance"" to get something good but most of the time its T3-4 crap that nobody needs. In order to buy the parts you need to must salvage these parts for robits, of which you get around 200-300 for a couple wheels. The high-level parts cost 100k+ robits.....The weapon system needs a rework. The flak cannon does nearly as much damage as a rail cannon even to targets on the ground, the rockets do waaaay to much damage to still have a tracking system(nerf one of the two), and the new shotguns blow away half your bot if not destroying it completely even at full CPU.The decision to take away mega-bots was COMPLETELY MORONIC. I had a mega before the update that I spent hours building and getting parts for, it's now in pieces in my inventory. Mega-bots were one of the things that made the game great, you could team up with group of lower level players and take one on in an epic ""boss battle.""  It was extremely awesome, but now it's gone.... I had also spent money to pay for some parts and to get premium(which is also now utterly useless as it only gives an extra uncommon quality item at the end of the battle, roughly 150-200 robits if salvaged...)

22297,Robocraft,2015.0,"Early Access ReviewStarting with the good stuff, the game gives you a lot of options, from what shape your vehicle to tactics and platooning, its got a large variety of building blocks that you of course use to build your robots, a decent amount of maps and a big tech tree. There is also not soo much stuff to buy so its not a pay-to-win game, GOOD STUFF! There are a couple things that bother me tho, the chat channel mechanic is very rough, the people you get to chat with when you are not in a battle are random, PLEASE FIX IT GUYS! id apreciate :D. There is also not much of a drag, friction and gravity mechanic tho so all the surfaces are glass-like...kinda annoying if you ask me cuz you slide down slopes like its nobodys bussiness. Unfortunately tho in this game there are two design type that are really OP (due to the fact that the game doesnt really have good phisics) and the comunity is divided, some say that it has turned into a really messy MOBA because of the new gamemode, others are not happy about block nerfing and more. And yes, personally, i did quit the game because it got repetitive! And the thing is that when you get in (or any tier) tier 10 just BARELY, your next like 20 battles are going to be bad, ur just gunna die and die and die...just because you dont have the equipment that the other guys have. I definantely think that instead of 10 tiers, there should be like 20 . Now you are happy when you are finishing a tier and when you get into the next one its like ,,omg wtf can i do to not constantly diie for f sakes?!?!,, (and thats the point where i quit the game in tier 10..)

Which also allowed expierence users to build bots with just enough points to play in sudden tiers. So you could face off smaller bots with your own small bot while now that isn't posible. Ofcourse you can run with a small bot but now you will face off bots of 2000CP...Now there is only 2 tiers, bellow 2000 and above 2000 which are custom games entirely.Instead we get now loot boxes at the end of a round xx if u won xx if u lost.All the blocks have been removed and we got only normal or the light blocks left.I won't say that the tallent system was good but this is even worse.Catch up system being broken, while you have the entire match 3 points active.The enemy team can destroy a crystal and win with 1 point active while we have 2 afterwards.What the f-ck ?!? its like having 90% and they have 30% yet they can still win with the crystal.I understand that you want a catch up system but I've never seen it this bad.I didn't write this review because I hate the game.The opposite is true I just wish they never simplified the game like this.",0

This game used to be filled with a fun, fair leveling system, but this new ""pay-to-win"" makes so many things are so unbalanced, and it feels like only the ""rich"" can really benefit out of this game. I had tried to love the game so hard many times, but it go to a point where it was just too ridiculous.

Anytime you are about to get wrecked, the pilot would jet pack escape and zoom around the map at 2000+ MPH. Eventually you would get stuck, and die by a plasma bomb. That was entertaining. Played the game just to do that. This gave the game an extra tactical and engineering dimension.This feature and the pilot was REMOVED, and replaced with a simplified hit point threshhold of your over all robot.

Removed the (i dont even know how to say this anymore) ""league/normal/non-league"" gamemode and now I dont even know how to play this. In conclusion: Once a great game, now ruined by its own creators hungry for money. I strongly DO NOT RECOMMEND this to anyone (except those who want to lose their time and money).",0
22310,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access Reviewi just returned to this game yesterday, i remembered it before my older computer crapped out due to hardware issues early this year. and i have to say compaired then to now, the game feels like it's a complete mess. let's begin with the controls to follow the curser to cause turning is probably the best controls you are going to get, i tried turning my vehicle with wasd and it felt very unresponsive and downright clunky. next lets talk about the gameplay itself, who the hell thought it was a good idea to make death match a jumbled mess? death match and brawl are the first two game modes you might play when you start this game, and both are ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. a lvl 1 can be placed with someone levels above him with better vehicles and better weapons. and the main currency in the game that you need to purchase weapons and blocks to make a better vehicle is locked behind recyling blocks in order to make any profit. but the prices are all over the map, for example a common blaster might cost less then a common radar why? who the ♥♥♥♥ cares not to mention the crazy prices people expect you to pay with this hard to obtain currency in the factory. the factory ok let me put it to you like this, a vehicle with maybe 1k cpu or less can sometimes be sold for 20,000 in game currency may i remind you this currency can only be obtained by either A.) recyling parts that you get from chests or b.) selling your current abomination in the factory and hoping that someone or multiple parties will purchase it but even then you are only getting a little bit of currency per purchase. lastly lets talk about the reward system aka the chest system. no matter how good you do in a losing battle i have found you will either get bronze or rust level chests containing items that either a are just blocks or b sell for very little cash making it next to impossible to purchase better items or a better vehicle model from the factory. it may just be because i just rejoined this game yesterday but it doesn't feel balenced, how can it when you have a enemy in the sky that has a multi lock weapon that chips off 15- 20 health a hit. it's not fun and it's a horrible mess. i hope the devs fix this instead of worrying about stuff like premium another feature that limits the fun you can have in this game. you need it to unlock paints custom avi's and to get bonus items that are LOCKED from a players earned chest. premium in a game like this feels like a stupid idea, considering that most chests will give you 6 items and 3 of them are locked behind premium. here's hoping again that the devs will put some serious work into this game, i hate to see a game i enjoyed so much from 2 years ago fall so far since i have been away.",0
22311,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewOh how this game used to be good, this game about 2 years ago back when the tech tier was a thing I loved this game but after I wiped my pc because of bad malware I forgot about it and never redownloaded it until today and it's awful.

22315,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI started playing this game about a month back. At first, it was a cool little game and it was fun creating  mechs. Let alone seeing other people's creations. However, with the most recent update, the game tends to freeze. Everyone in the match is able to talk via chat box but is unable to move their bot. Another complain I have is the Factory. Being able to purchase people's creations is nice but at the same time it takes away from the game. The most over used bots are the teslas and drones. One person makes the perfect mech and everyone buys it. What I suggest is instead of letting people sell their creations, the game devs should sell bot frames of their own in the factory. Basically just the core of the bot and nothing else. The person buying the frame could then design and modify it the way they want. All in all, I give this game a 5/10. At first, it was fun to log on daily. Now, it's a bummer watching the game go down hill.",0
22316,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewI really liked this game at one point, so i'll try to do an honest review, but I am a little bit biased, more on that later.   This game used to be amazing, there was a point to building things, it was fun, you could build cool looking things and they would work if built properly, it was just a good idea for a game.   I loved it tbh.   Now comes the bad news....No tiers - You literally begin playing the game against people that are lvl 100+ and yes, you will die a lot.Energy System - forces you to build smaller robots to use most high end weapons, or build large robots with no damageRandom new weapons - They literally keep getting worse and more OP, if you have the tesla and invisibilty you can just drive around running over people and ruining matches for players who spent time building and designing things to play the game the way it was meant to be♥♥♥♥ MODS - They will literally ban you for talking in chat a lot, and heaven forbid you take the time to defend the game, because they won't see that, they'll just see some little f*cking b*stard child ♥♥♥♥♥ing about how you hurt their feelings, and ban you again♥♥♥♥ DEVS - Yes, i said that, they've literally been getting terrible reviews for months and they listen to what we have to say, and do the opposite.   NOONE wanted the removal of Tiers, we all liked the design, and yet the Devs removed it, waited til we complained, and then made it worse by ruining matchmakingToxic Community - Dont ever complain in chat.   Just dont do it.   Children will cry cuz you had an opinion, the Trolls will call you a liar to the MODS face while mods been in chat the whole time, and the idiot MODS are children also so yeah, banned for upsetting 5 year oldsIn conclusion, i'd just like to point out 1 more time, children are ruining games.   They have no money, and terrible ideas, but we the people that actually buy premium and pay for games like this get ignored.   This game had a point, and was hard to learn, and rewarding once you did.   It has since been ruined by childish complainers, and bad MODS, and poor choices by the Development team.   I used to love the designers, but honestly, I wouldn't pay a penny for this now.   Unless you have 1000+ hours to spend getting gear, you'll be useless at best, and cannon fodder at worst.

Both with super massive weapon that one-shoot you.Tech tree was a good way to prevent this, and even if people wanted to pay, they will go in match with adversary with same size weaponother thing really boring, now you can't win currency. you win loot crates, so basically now, even if you get good crate, you have to wait very long time to build good robot (funny for a building game isn't it?), and to have at least good crate, you have to be first or at least on 5 first players of a game, so goodbye team play.and maybe the worst in this, it's that the developers doesn't even care about comments, players etc. (oh yeah they care about money sorry)",0

They got offended and decided to silence said friend for ""Profanity"" reasons.I don't reccomend this game, especially after ALL of the progression changes as updates go by, and the sensitive devs who cannot take criticism.Don't bother with the game.

No strategy and tactics.Developers completely lost...",0
22327,Robocraft,2017.0,"Early Access ReviewThis game has become very broken for many of reasons.1. The matchmaking, is, im sorry, BS. You got literally mechs of over 1500+ facing off against starter 500-900+ CPU bots. The game was honestly amazing when they actually had LEGIT fair MM.2. The anti-cheat mechanic is, atleast from how I have been seeing it, not working at all and infact even supporting hackers. Alot of people are breaking the spawnprotection of new robocrafters and even teleporting around (by this, im not including the blink module).3. The crates. Yes, the crates. These little buggers have become the death to many of people. Rusted crates, usually bad stuff, but super rare things? That makes no sense. If you got a rust crate, you would crappy stuff, its that simple. Plutonium crates (the best one) dont even give good things, and when they do, you have literally made such an overpowered bot that its useless. Reading one of the reviews from some other people, I have to agree, this game has became a pay to win. Paying to win games is what kills young audiences like myself who actually enjoy the game in order to be creative, to let our young minds be shown into these amazing and well put together bots. But no, CRATES had to come in and ruin everything, hell, it even ruined my childhood. For people who ""pay to win"" they also get ripped off because for example, if I was to buy say about 60 plutonium crates, I would be getting good and epic items from only like 20 of them. Yes, 20. Plutonium crates are suppose to be the best crates ever right? Well, where is the good loot? I dont need all these random blocks and uncommon and rare stuff, im expecting epic and legendary items. Its a waste of money.Thanks to these reasons, even though the devs may not care that its 1 person, I will be retiring from robocraft till things are fixed. If anyone cares to join me, I say lets boycott together, not only as individuals, but as a huge group of robocraft lovers and creative minders alike. Thank you for your time and understanding.-POLICEUNIT",0
22328,Robocraft,2018.0,"This game in 2014 was all I played. It was fun, logged 350 hours playing this game, but over time the developers have ruined this game, it went from really fun to sucking after they took the tier system away to only replace it with something that doesn't work at all. You have to pay for premium in order to get anything good in the ""chest system"" and if you don't have premium they pretty much tell you to f*ck yourself, and only give you half of whats actually in the box, and 99% of the time it's junk. it used to be fun, But the chest system ruined it. I hate playing this game now, I just installed it again after deleting it, but nothing has changed. I think they should bring back the good old days when it wasn't a pile of sh*t. The developers are super greedy and it shows. They have made everything about this game ""pay to win"" if you can fork over 100$  or more you can have an okay experince but if you're like me and enjoy the grind, then this game isn't for you.

22333,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewHello Steam community it great to meet you all, thank you for taking the time to gaze at my review. Frist off, I start by saying after playing well over 668.0 hours of Robocraft, I come to a turning point. the crativity that once made the game enjoyable has become sadly ended in my own option.  no more will you see duck or boat, or even cute anime robots. the choice to jump on to a loot based game system left a bad taste.I really try to embrace the new changes.  but time and time agian the move to a a more competitive tournaments style of gaming to me rune the beauty the game once had.I really do love the the ideal the game give, i love to be ceative. building a robots in robocraft was once rewarding, i use to enjoy battleing and come across someone who would creative with there own robots battle mine, notice funny than seeing a  hat waring duck battle a big piggy, but you dont see anything like that now.Most matches are now all competitive tournament robot are build for only one idea to win loot crates to get the best weapons & armor.when I was at about 500hrs into robocraft I started to notice the change. but the last few changes I hope things would return to a playable game, but sadly the introduction to loot crate, have only reward people who have enough spare time and money to buy them, it make the game feel cheep. feel like a cash grabing tactic in my own opinion.If you new player, you're robots are only going ot be meat for the higher level players with the best weapons and armor. but that being siad.  the game still offer enjoyable gaming for competitive players. but if you just want to be creative player then sady this is not the game for some people.Talking aobut what i liked and dislike about the game has all change.  becuase this is not the same game i played when i frist started playing robocraft,  with before there tier system you had balance, with the exponential scale in Robocraft that determines how strong a robot was, and what other robots it could battle, but now with the matches base on cpu  favior poeple who buy loot crates to who then make lower cpu robots with extramly powerful weapons witch then in my opion then rune experince.I also sadly if you had ask me  a year ago to recommend the game i would have, but becuase of overtiering and introduction to Loot crates system, having to pay primum monthly jsut for extra pant colors, really under vaule the game. so with a vary heavy hart i must sadlly un-recomend this game to anyone who  think the game offer crativty and fun enjoyable gamming. and only  .....*sighs*..... recomment this  for people who are competitive tournament player types.",0
22334,Robocraft,2016.0,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewRecommendation: Not Recommended.81.9 hrs on recordEARLY ACCESS REVIEWSo I will begin with the description of the game Robocraft, it's purpose and what you do in it. Brief Description So... Robocraft is a multiplayer game in which 2 teams must battle it out until the final survivor from 1 team. What makes this game unique? Well you don't battle with cars or any other things, instead you battle with your personal created Robot. This Robot you create will matter highly how you create it if you want to survive long in the battlefield. How it works: You start off with a few tier 1 blocks as you do in the game, you build your basic first time robot and go into battle in order to get some credits. After a bit of grinding you have enough money to buy more things to add onto your robot like guns, wheels, rocket boosters, more blocks (blocks are classed as armor so the more and better you setup your robot the more hits it can take) and so as you keep adding things to your robot, you reach a robot reputation level if I remember correctly and once you pass a required robot reputation you tier up and unlock higher tier guns, blocks, wheels, boosters and at later game, wings, shields, propellers, helium tanks etc..So doesn't sound too bad right now does it? Multiplayer game with custom created robots which can fly, hover or drive whilst fighting with guns, destroying other robots. But... At the beginning you couldn't notice a lot of P2W factors fbut there were some minor ones which didn't make a lot of difference, the one feature which many people would pay for are, custom created robots created by the developing team for different tiers. However after a few months things have started going slightly uphill with the amount of p2w things being released. So much that you can tell that the developers must be in a struggle. Here's where they went REALLY wrong. What They Did Wrong This is an honest review, and I honestly will tell you to stay away from this garbage. Don't get me wrong, the game USED to be good, it USED too. Now it's a terrible game and that's as kindly as I will go. What's wrong with it you ask? Well they started bringing out absolute TERRIBLE and useless updates, I never saw worse updates for a game than that. It first started with an all of a sudden Level boost for every single player for no reason which meant that all those players that spent a lot of time trying to reach the max level (100) wasted their time when they could have reached lvl 60 and have their level boosted till like lvl 85. Then they brought out a new game mode, that game mode was so stupid that if you was not level 80+ you was wasting your time playing, this is because you was playing against over tiered enemies whilst you could be a hugely lower level. Another thing, they made it so that you pay to win different colored blocks for your robot.. Yes, blocks that have a different color. You have to pay real money for that now... Oh and I just found out that they added a way for you to open crates to get super cool legendary weapons for no reason. Yeah, this game was good it had good level progression, fair match making due to different tiered robots get tiered with similar tiers making it a fair match. Now that doesn't exist and it all depends on how much money you got in your bank accouunt.I recommend you stay away from this game, It's annoying to say this because I would have kept playing this game if not for these updates. But hey, the game is free so if you're not conviced by this review, you can see it for yourself as the game is free.

22335,Robocraft,2016.0,"i played this game a lot in its early days. Now its truly just... bad, nothings in balance anymore and it comes across as being more p2w than most other p2w games.Ive genuinely never seen a game go so far downhill between Beta and Release, its almost heartbreaking, during the beta i couldve imagined myself playing this for thousands of hours.Not anymore",0
22336,Robocraft,2016.0,"Early Access ReviewReally funny first, but multiplayer is ""not so nice"" (censoring sucks). (3/10)First i really liked Robocraft. it's a funny and innovative idea and the game runs with very few errors in the single player modes. Then I started the multiplayer and I was quite dissappointed. My internet connection is totally fine but this game simply doesn't work for me.Every match I can play 1 minute, then I can't hit players anymore and I can't get hit. It's like the worst lags ever. After a few more minutes I randomly die but can't respawn but because you can't simply leave the match you either have to wait 10 minutes until thematch is over and at least get some points or restart the game. Then, when the game has ended for anyone else I finally get the ""connection lost"" window so I get back to the Robo selection menu. These were the issues I had 3 months ago and I thaught ""okay, lets stop playing for a while, maybe they fix it""So I got back and re-installed it a week ago and what do I see? They added Lootcrates which totally destroyed the game and made it pay-to-win* but they had no time to finally fix the multiplayer bug that makes the game unplayable.EDIT (3rd Oct 2016): As I see the issue I had with multiplayer was finally fixed.But now there is in total about 60€ of DLC in this game that is still in early access... this is not good and I hope that no one supports this. Put your damn work in releasing the game and then worry about DLC. So in my opinion the game gained 2 points for fixing the issue and lost them again for this crap... well done!* since I could now finally test the MP I saw that the lootcrates' impact on the game wasn't that bad so I put 1 point back to the score for that. still very disappointed.P.S.: I'll take a break again because I still don't think this is worth playing and edit again if I see something worth mentioning (like a final release mabye one day...).",0

Now, if you don't pay money you are severly underpowered against the vast amount of pay to win people. They nerfed all items that were obtainable legit, and made it so you can just buy robots from other people. You dont even have to build robots now, just pay money to get robots.

Most idle games don't often require strategy to get far fast but this game utilizes it and even challenges you with it. However if strategy isn't your thing it merits you for keeping a set formation for a set length of time with free dps bonuses.However this game is not yet done, but trust me where it's at already is pretty play worthy.",1
22862,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2016.0,"For a free game it is very good and is very ADDICTIVE! For a clicker game it has good durability with its various challenges, updates and holiday events.It makes you think about who to level up, then consider what items you have to boost each character and what formations suit who. All in all it is a breath of fresh air as far as the clicker game genre goes.",1
22863,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2016.0,Its a idol/clicker game... What do you expect?Its trying to trick you into buying purchases for a character you may never use.I activated only because of a humble bundle Yogcast related freebie.,0
22864,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2016.0,"The devs made it overcomplicated for a idle game.The whole purpose of a idle clicker is to play it in between games, while your cs:go match is not ready or when your friend goes to the bathroom, and for that purpose, Crusader of the Lost Idols fails horribly. If you're willing to play it on hardcore mode (which I doubt) you'll may find it great. But if you are like me, and wants a nice game while your ranked dota match takes 10 min to find, this is the worst option possible.3/10",0
22865,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2016.0,"I've seen several of these ""time wasters"" on my phone.  You get wrapped up in watching the numbers climb.  Overall, it is just a time waster.  Has zero to do wtih adventuring or RPGs.",0
22866,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2017.0,"Unfortunately this game has no real offline progress calculation like my other idle games. Sure you get gold and xp based on time offline, but no actual levels skipped. It is a huge waste of computer resources to keep this game constantly running to actually make the auto-progress feature work. (Maxes out one of my CPU cores and eats ♥♥♥ MB ram)I enjoy the core gameplay loop, the new crafting system (multiple characters decked out in 5 times upgraded legendaries, yay!)Having to start over from level 1 all the time however, is a hassle. I can instant kill my way up to level 200 with any unupgraded level 1 hero, so why can't I just skip to that point automatically? Speechacking helps to cut down on time wastage, but still... Also, once level 200 is reached I just buy every hero and upgrade and proceed to instakill all the way to level 700 without touching the game once. No challenge. And once the challenging part is reached I can just reset... This is not as much fun anymore. Watching the game play itself oh so very slowly.Levels that require you to constantly click (two examples are invisible enemies in mugwarts, and the unkillable aliens in last week's event that die to one click) can't be afk'd.

You will get a lot of heroes with different abilities, which can be useful with different formations and conditions of game worlds. Yes, here player not simple clicking the same five buildings or one monster slot, but run a series of quests in a different worldsets with a little story in them.Each two weeks game have an events in which you can obtain up to four new heroes (I think that there will be ""up to six"" near halloween) and gather a lot of idols.

22877,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2015.0,"Truly, this game is the absolute bottom of the barrel in terms of idle/clicker games.  I will start by saying this, the game mechanic is fun and the game itself is enjoyable.  The team formatting is unique and diverse.That being said.This game represents all of the unbridled greed that game developers seem to find themselves filled with these days.  In terms of raw micro-transaction COST, this game is the most expensive game on the market.  In addition, this game has been out for quite some time on Kongregate.com prior to being released on Steam.  As a game developer I find Kongregate to be a great community and I've enjoyed seeing other titles such as AdVenture Capitalist, Time Clickers, and Clicker Heroes make amazing transitions over to the Steam community.The same can NOT be said for this game.Why?All the aforementioned titles all had one thing in common.  If you spent money on in-game micro-transactions on Kongregate ALL of those bonuses carried over to the Steam platform.  Players were given the ability to ""Export"" their save game code and then ""Import"" it once on Steam.  Even for idle/clicker games that are only on Kongregate this is common practice.  At this point it has become an expected ""best practices"" within the industry.Crusaders of the Lost Idols does NOT do this.Kongregate users have been calling for ages for the ability to import/export save codes.  Even more-so once it was announced that this title would be being released on Steam.  Users repeatedly reached out to the developers attempting to make contact with them.  The devs were silent for over 4 months.Finally, one day, the devs decided to finally appease the masses and actually engage themselves with their community.  That's when we all discovered the awful truth.  The devs were simply trying to rob their players.The developers announced they were making the CONCIOUS choice to refuse data transfers to players in their community who spent real money on in-game bonuses.  Spent $50 on chests when the game was first released on Kongregate-only, well you don't get to keep those bonuses.  Better spend another $50 if you want all your perks again!  Eh?While I have not EVER spent money on this game, and have thus not lost out due to this, I find this to be one of the most unethical decisions I have seen a non-EA/Blizzard game developer make.  It undermines the entire indie community.Despite the fun gameplay, due to the underhandedness of the developers, I would advise everyone to avoid this game and not support it.  Heck, since it's free to play install it then downvote it with a review.  Players, and consumers in general, need to take a stand against greedy developers like Code Name. ",0
22878,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2016.0,In game purchases are broken.  Half the time you will get charged and get nothing for it.This game is a scam.They will charge people and oftentimes do not give them their chests. Players will think it didn't go through on Valve's side and make a second purchase. Most won't notice while playing late at night and they won't fix the problem unless or until you notice and write a ticket at their site. There are no refunds.  They'll just toss you the microtransaction which didn't work (if you're lucky).The bug that caused this has been there for months and they've done nothing to correct it. Why should they when it's a good way to exploit people?,0
22879,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2016.0,"I regret getting into this.I very quickly became...well, for lack of a better term...obsessed.I would buy chests whenever they would do the ""free"" golden upgrade when you buy a chest! Over the course of playing this game I've spent quite a pretty penny. You can only get the best weapons through those limited time deals, which is why they would sucker me in. There is a problem when the best content is locked behind a never ending pay wall. That is where I draw the line between a ""good"" free to play game and a bad one. This is a bad one with grabby money tactics. And for every new flavor of the event crusaders that are added, there a ""special limited time only"" chests to buy to get equipment just for them!! It honestly just feels so scammy. The prices are a LOT for what you are getting. You do NOT get a good value, at all, don't let their ""sales"" fool you.  Don't waste your money on this game. They add only benched heroes, no actual new ones...so, in other words, you are perpetually swapping out your favorite crusaders for the new cash-grab flavor of the event crusaders (that are almost always better). There are a few positives, such as a nice passive trait tree they've added. But, let me warn you, this game gets very repetitive when you do the exact. same. thing. over. and. over. and. over. You will hardly ever switch up your technique (until the new flavor of the event) because that one group is effective for anything you'd do. I am a lover of idle games...just not this one. Try Tap Titans instead. It is superior to this game tenfold. And they don't lock the best stuff behind a never ending treadmill of purchases.Note: if you have a lot of self control so you do not spend money, and you don't mind the best items being locked behind event pay walls that refresh every month or so, don't mind the pointless grind (because you aren't really working towards anything worth getting, even though they do have a passive way to spent idols...it just doesn't feel rewarding), and if you don't mind using the same crusaders (because they never add any new heroes, they only add heroes to existing benches... it's hard to explain if you don't play the game. You'll have to swap out your favorite heroes for the flavor of the event)...if you don't mind any of that, you will like this game.I, on the other hand, am tired of supporting these horrible free to play market developers who, when all is said and done, gets a lot more money from people by their sly tricks than AAA/Indie developers of REAL GAMES will get... and that is just sad. From now on, I pledge myself to only purchase from legit game developers...those that care about more than just money and releasing an endless treadmill of cash grabby crap.Edit: I wish that I could find a screenshot. I can't help but laugh hysterically... the new shop page has two special event chests promotions going on!!! A set of 3 chests costs 5$!! They used to be 2.99$!! And, get this, ""Buy an event jeweled chest bundle today and get a FREE GOLDEN EPIC CARD that you won't find anywhere else!"". And there are two unique ones because there are two unique event chests going on... holy scam. Please, please, don't support these developers.Stop giving them money. I beg you not to do it. Don't fall into the trap. We, as people, have to tell devleopers that this is the wrong way of making money. Why are these online prices, something you will never see or feel in your hand, something that is temporary, something that is completely RNG (you most likely will get crap out of your 3 chests you buy for 5$ because they want you to buy a bunch of them... 42 chests for 50$ would still give you crap once you get going in your game and have a few hundred hours of time spent...)...something that is not guaranteed should NEVER BE THAT MUCH MONEY!! This market isn't for the customers, despite it's ""free"" nature...those that actually pay and support the developers are being ripped off by ridiculously high prices for what the stuff is actually worth. Maybe I am alone in this...maybe not. Only time will tell how this market goes.",0

Not only do you unlock new heroes, you place them in formation (10 on screen at a time) and certain ones will interact with others causing bonuses to damage and such. On top of that, there are the expected items to gain that boost damage and gold gains. The biggest difference I noticed, between this one and Clicker Heroes, is that this one scrolls from left to right, as if the characters are walking through the forest or environment. Additionally, if the monsters get to your heroes, they actually damage and can kill them for that round, causing you to need to go back a level and earn more gold.The interface is great, easy to pickup and understand, and the gameplay is just fun. There's also XP gain, which means that after 5 hours of having a hero in formation, their DPS will double due to XP gained. It's a small but nice touch.There's really a lot to like about this game, and it's done something very right with its entering the clicker scene. Not only has it got its own charm and style, it sets itself apart enough from the crowd that it has managed to truly bring something new to the scene.Certainly worth your download.",1

22905,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2017.0,"The game is pay to win. There is no end game, and only endless chests or hours of mindless grinding will get you real progress. The problem is the loot system which works on a 5 tier system: common, uncommon, rare, epic and golden epic. The loot is progressive so uncommon is a better version of common, rare is a better version of uncommon, and so on. There is no choice of equipment - they simply keep the highest tier available and disenchant the rest.Common, uncommon and rare drop from silver chests, the game's currency which each contain 3 items. VERY rarely a silver chest will be upgraded for free (about one in a hundred?) from a silver chest to a 'Jewelled' chest.These jewelled chests contain 5 items one of which will be rare or above. EPIC gear can only be had from these chests. These chests are sold 3 for $4.99. Buying chests is the difference between 'I might get the achievements this week' and 'See you in 2025'. Chest purchases also grant you a 24 hour 100% damage increase. Cheap, eh?What's worse is the Golden Epics. They come with 'flash sales' which appear periodically to try and pressure you into buying them within a 8-10 hour window. They are ridiculously powerful. Many grant 150% bonuses when common items might be 5%. There are ALOT of these golden epics. You'd have to spend hundreds of dollars just to get those that exist right now, and more to get those they add with each update. Power creep is inherent here - they bring out new characters and gear to outdate the stuff you paid for so you'll buy more stuff. It's a hamster wheel of pay to win crap.What's worse is the dev's have had bugs with the Golden Epic system awarding the wrong things - and refusing to correct all of it even though it's their fault. Even if you give them REAL MONEY for a in-game digital benefit which costs them nothing, they'll still give you the short end of the stick if their crap system glitches.This is nothing but a mobile phone quality java game that rewards continuous spending and excessive playtime over any semblence of logic, skill, or ability.

They know it takes forever to level up by idling, they know its time consuming and you'll ultimately get nowhere. They want it that way, so that you spend money on microtransactions and DLC. As a disclaimer, I got the DLC I have for free, and let me tell you, I would never pay real money for it. The DLC is basically worthless, you get items that aren't even useful until waaay later into the game.Problem number 3, the idles. You get so far in the game and you can reset which you get rewarded with idles. But you'll get VERY few, I'd be suprised if you get over twenty. Doesn't seem like too much of a problem right? Wrong. It takes HUNDREDS of idles to get the upgrades for them. So you have to sink hours and hours into the game to even get there. They want you to pay for the microtransactions however. In the end this all comes down to personal preference, If you're a fan of (in my opinion) wasting your money by playing a completely pay to win game, go right a head. I wouldn't recommend it, I've sunk many hours into, and I've only been able to reset ONCE, and got twelve idles. Not worth the time, or the electricity to play. Avoid it, please.",0

When it goes to full screen it doesn't take up your entire monitor making the quality look like utter sh*t. I think the most annoying part of this game was the tutorial wizard (literal tutorial wizard), it really shouldn't take 5 minutes for it to go away and let you explore the game yourself, instead of it staying on your screen just make it pop up whenever you find something new (which it does, but consider cutting out most of the beginning tutorial..).Try it if you want to waste a few minutes and see if you like it.

The game became horribly imbalanced and no longer fun to play as the core mechanism, tweaking formations, was replaced by P2W.  Horribly disappointing turn of events for a formerly great game.Original review:This game really surprised me.  It\'s an incredibly simple concept, your crusaders are walking along, enemies show up, and they kill them, gold drops, you level up, ad nausium.  The game designers have managed to turn it into a surprisingly deep bit of strategy with combinations of gear, formations, abilities, missions, etc that all interact so that no experience of the game is the same until much later when you\'ve got most of the gear and the math begins to flatten out.The time recorded in game is a bit deceptive, as I leave it running in the background.  Actual interaction time is FAR lower, that said it\'s an epic grind to get all the campaigns completed and will likely take you months or years of on-off play unless you shell out lots of $$$.  It won\'t win any awards for exciting action, but it\'s a fun little game to play at work in 1-2 minute spurts",0

It doesn't demand much attention and, once you're through the early stages, it mostly plays itself, leaving you to just interact with it to make occasional upgrades or lineup changes, but the progression and rewards are perfectly timed leading to an almost irrestitiable compulsion to remain at least partially engaged -- you're always just on the cusp of making progress, and the fact that you can just leave it doing its thing means that it's easy to just give it a couple of minutes, and then another couple more, and all of a sudden you realise it's been running for 12 hours straight.The UI is a little clunky and there's definitely some rough edges, but the core of the product is so well built I wouldn't be surprised to find out it was either the result of a psychology experiment, or even that it *was* an psychology experiment.Now if you'll excuse me, I just have to make one more upgrade, and then...",1

Without graphics you will likely be unable to deploy crusaders or change formation by pulling benched crusaders.Given that this problem still persists, I would not recommend this game to players outside of North America as that is where their servers hosting the game's assets are located. If you are geographically far from said region then you may experience inconsistent loading of the game's numerous graphics resulting in a frustrating, and close to unplayable game.** EDIT - 17 Jun 2017 **The developers discreetly pushed an update and a lot of graphical assets were added to the local directory being used by the Steam version of the game client.It seems to have greatly helped in sorting out the missing graphics.

22945,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2016.0,"I love this game!They balanced it really well so that there's not a whole lot of ""idle"" time, at least not until higher levels when you start to hit your party's limits. At that point, restarting your game will reward some Idols which give permanent DPS (damage per second) and gold percentage increases, so the next time through you'll be able to get further.You only have to click to kill with your starting character (the Bushwhacker); all others automatically do damage to the closest enemy on the screen. And it doesn't take long to save up and recruit the 2nd character, so if you don't like to click spam then this game doesn't make you do it much. But if you do like it, there are plenty of upgrades to make it worth while. It's totally up to you whether or not to click for extra damage after you recruit the 2nd character. I always replace the Bushwhacker with someone else as soon as I've recruited that many characters.Some characters do high DPS, some boost the DPS of other characters, and some increase the amount of gold enemies drop. So there's a strategy to deciding which characters to field in your party, depending on your immediate goals. There are three save slots so you can save different party configurations and quickly switch between them. I like to have a DPS party for progressing, and a gold-finding party for when I log off or if I want to save up for something.Another fun strategy is rearranging your party members for maximum DPS output. Some characters boost the DPS of erveryone in front of them, and others boost the DPS of everyone next to them. So put your highest damage dealers in a position to get boosted by both!Most characters have a skill that quadruples their DPS output every 25 levels, and there's no limit to this that I know of.Every five levels has a boss character with a chance of dropping a chest. Chests have large amounts of gold as well as items that your characters can equip for bonuses. The items stay with your characters after resetting the game. If you find a duplicate item for a character, their DPS is permantently boosted by a small percentage.I can't think of anything bad about the game. It is what it is: A casual, side-scrolling, click & idle RPG with basic but cute graphics. It's not Diablo or Grim Dawn, but like those games the magic is in the gameplay. Deciding what to upgrade next, saving up for it, getting it, and watching the satisfying effects of your good choices as your DPS meter skyrockets and the enemies start dieing almost instantly. Then you can advance a few levels, where the enemies are a bit tougher but the gold drops are much richer, and gladly do it again!",1

22947,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2016.0,"addictive!! good balance and progressively more complex strategies available at a pace that keeps it interesting, challenging, but manageable. the formation skills make for a really fun system of maximization as you have to balance crusaders with high DPS & crusaders with useful effects. changing even the positioning can really affect how your team functions! instead of just deciding how to spend gold like other clickers, you have to actually reevaluate your strategy as you unlock new abilities and bonuses from different crusaders, since you can't have them all on the field at once.you can save 3 formations for easy switching depending on what tactic you want; personally I have one to maximize gold, clicks, and DPS so that I can easily farm, boss, or progress more quickly.agree with other comments that this is MUCH better than clicker heroes, much more balanced and interesting. the long-term looks like it'll be rewarding too!edit: back after 18 hours and oh lordy, the reset opens up so many directions. lots of different objectives requiring different strategies and formation shapes with unique twists, plus the mission system, and multiple heroes to a seat with holiday varieties... long-term is almost overwhelming but with enough direction / progressively unlocking options so as to not leave you floundering. love it, nominating for the 5 more minutes category for sure!",1

None of my friends understand why this game is open in my account almost constantly and it is not possible to explain with mere words. If you are a perfectionist and materially obsessed person, this game could be worse to you than a night in the casino to an gambling addict.",1
22966,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2017.0,"The Crusaders of the Lost Idols is probably one of the best idle game out there, with well thought mechanics. Craftings, talents and quests add enough to the game to make it more interesting than other similar idle game. However, it will also suffer the same flaw: past a certain point, it becomes extremely repetitive and at most, you'll probably only 5 minutes at a time to upgrade your game and let it back to its idle state.PROS+ Easy gameplay+ Funny graphics+ Quest/Talents/CraftsCONS- Rapidly repetitive",1
22967,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2017.0,"Funny characters, additional contents now and then, an extra event every month (at the moment with three levels - so even those who have been playing for a while feel they can play some more). Ingame currency to buy perks and improvements, crafting items ... What more would you need to consider an idle  game ideal?Well, it would be nice to trade different crafting materials (to be used in recepies) if you have excess of one and more of another. And how about giving the characters ad hoc speech bubbles, e.g. when they kill a creature they could say ""yeaaah"" or somehing along those ways?OK, kidding, these are just small nitty picky details - this game is the ""ideal idle"". Go for it, try it - just a few minutes ... just do not be surprised when you find yourself going back to it, day after day, just to peak ... or play some more. ",1
22968,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2017.0,"Update: So after almost 750 hours I am still hooked to the game and they have made nice changes. I generally like the game, but progressing in it get rather frustrating. I have already actively played 21 h and not been able to unlock the second achievement. I unlocked all warriors by level 50 and really wish there were more. It takes forever to level up the warriors to surpasse level 100, which is the second achievement. That said, I really don't want to put actual money in a game like this, but I fear that might be the key to enjoyment. I am torn, whether or not I would recommend this game. It is fun for a very short while, but then it has already sucked you in and stopping gets hard. I wish there was an 'undecided' option.",1
22969,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2017.0,"I wanted to see what was up with all this Clicker game retardation. Well, I saw and it was just what I thought it was: a pleasure pill dispenser on rapid auto-fire. No substance, barely any ""strategy"" and I'm stretching to use the word, so don't expect any thinking needed. This is a Facebook game for those that want RPG flavor without the hassle of RPG playing.If you're a fan of clicker games, yes, this is probably better than others. If you're not, no this is not something so totally different than others that it is worthy of being called good entertainment.",1
22970,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2017.0,"Crusaders of the Lost Idols has a ton of content to play, and it gives players plenty of free chests and items and drops that paying is never a barrier. Daily quests and missions as well as monthly events add to the content level constantly. It is a wonderful idle game that never stoops to being anywhere near pay to win, and does whhat it can to keep things fresh. I recommend it heartily to anyone with an interest in idle games in general.",1
22971,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2017.0,"Awesome idea. I support this game. I love that it keeps making progress even when you arent playing, so you have this huge stash of gold when you come back sometimes.

Don't try this at supervised office computer, though), and come back once in a while to upgrade all your crusaders, then get back to what you were doing.The fairly recent addition of Mission makes collecting crusaders worth it.This game is an example of how F2P should be, many freebies - you can buy Jeweled Chests using Rubies which generously given by daily tasks and missions, and every event there are at least 3 Jeweled Event Chests for you, plus 1 extra for you newsletter subscriber.Definitely 5/7",1

I know many people don't like long reviews to read so i'll kepe each point short.1. Formations. Each objective has a formation you can put your crusaders in that allow you to set up bonuses and teamworks how you like.2. Regular events. New limited-time events come up at various parts of the year? Miss an event? No problem, many of them will be yearly events, with new crusaders to use.3. Mission system. Need extra rubies for the next chest? Miss an event and don't want to wait a year for a new crusader? Have a chance to earn it in the mission system.4. Frequent updates. New objectives and campaigns added in regularly, to keep you having new things to do.All in all, a great game everyone should try out.",1

Because sometimes people just need to watch some dudes walk in an extremely addictive and mind-numbing game. Cheers",1
22979,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2017.0,A typical click game. Still has a few bugs but has good potential. Also I've noticed some extras that most clickers don't have. At least the ones I've played. A simple casual game. I recommend it.,1
22980,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2018.0,"This is a game that I've loved since I stumbled onto it.It is an idle game, but one that actually has a lot to do in the game and with the events, it's something that seems like it might have a whole lot more to come.The humor is good and plays off of a lot of things, the progression is interesting with both specific challenges to push you further and the general, free play ones that just let you move forward in other ways.This game keeps me playing daily for over a year now with several thousand hours in...",1
22981,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2016.0,"This is a wonderful game, beautiful graphics.But I can't recommend it because of gamebreaking bugs. Including a strange one that claims you're logged in multiple windows, and one that results in not letting you play, period.""Uh Oh! Looks like something went wrong"" will quickly become your least favorite phrase in any language.I realize this is a beta, and I've done my part in telling the devs about the bugs. Until the bugs get fixed, though, I can't really recommend this game. I wish there was a ""neutral"" option, because this is a great game, if you can somehow dodge the bugs. I myself have over a THOUSAND HOURS logged on it!But since the game apparently doesn't like me, I don't like it.UPDATE Nov 23, 2018. I started a new game, I'm almost back where I was, although losing a couple Golden Epics. They added ""Taskmasters"", which are built in stuck-in-place autoclickers, you can either have them Level up ONE Crusader, or click on the battlefield,or trigger your Specials every time they come back online. It's good, so I'm changing to a yes vote. Please don't screw up again!",1
22982,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2017.0,"Crusaders of the Lost Idols is a labor of love with regular updates, and it is the best idle game I've played so far.Most Crusaders have formation abilities that support others, so you have to think about their placement. When you unlock new Crusaders or get equipment for them, you should adapt your strategies. Each campaign has a different formation layout, and many objectives have specific restrictions to work around - sometimes giving you a new appreciation for rarely used Crusader. Benched Crusaders can be send on missions to get goodies.I need no apologies for my hours on record, it's an idle game and I have patience. Progress could have been much faster with a more active playing style, but I would still not be finished with this addicting game!Edit: Well, now it's nearly a year later, and I keep on collecting new crusaders and rising my idol count, even though I've already gotten all the steam achievements. As I said before, this is an addicting game!",1

It's almost always running in the background on my computer.If the cartoony graphics don't deter you, there is a suprising amount of depth here, and a huge amount of content to explore/challenges (plus frequent holiday special events). Yes, I have given them some $ here and there - but I've never felt forced to do so in order to progress past some impossible paywall. It's to support the devs.  I can easily say this is one of the most reasonably priced and least pay-to-win free games I've played.",1

They release new content every few weeks and send you free shop codes via mail.",1
22985,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2018.0,"It is an incremental Game. What it needs: every some hours your attention to level up your crusaders.

22987,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2018.0,"Undoubtedly the best clicker game out there. At its core, you have tons of characters, each of them interacting with others to create the perfect formation to fight waves and waves of enemies of different difficulty.  Every single character has its own upgrades in the form of cards, and the cards have their own upgrades and so on, and so on. Basically you have tons of upgrades, way more than your usual idle game. It can go as far as feeling like an RPG or even a strategy, rather than an idle game. Especially if you check out the wikia page or any guide, and there are many.Of course, in the middle of it all, are the chests, which are your micro transactions. You can buy them with real money, as well as specific cards and bundles, but Crusaders of the lost idols is by no means pay to win/pay to progress. The player regularly receives codes for chests via e-mail, and there are plenty other ways to receive boosts without spending any money.EVENTS! The crusaders are filled with events on a regular basis, far more often than any game, idle or otherwise. They aren’t different from your regular runs, but the variety of characters you can acquire from them, is certainly keeping the game fresh.Finally, the community. Yes, a community in an idle game. Moving on from the initial surprise - the game has an in-game chat, mostly alerting everyone when someone gets an epic gear, but also giving you the ability to ask questions or talk the day away. Given that the Crusaders is not a competitive game, the community is extremely friendly, by far the best one I’ve encountered online. I have observed people from all walks of life share their story through the chat, and it is… Well, beautiful. No matter what type of gamer you are, this is something you can easily play between chores, or while doing literally anything - working, watching a movie, playing another game. I’ve enjoyed my fair share of idle games while doing tedious tasks, and Crusaders of the lost idols is definitely keeping it interesting, being rewarding and a bit challenging to top it off.",1
22988,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2018.0,"Strangely addictive. Not much to the game but one you can have on in the background as you watch TV. Updates all the time, so always something new. One of those games you just have to beat. Recommend to all who don't want anything to taxing.",1
22989,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2018.0,Another idle game so expect repetition and grinding for idols to progress. The most irritating part is the servers going down during events when idol gain buffs are active. What's the point when you're losing out on hours of potential gain because they can't keep the game from crashing.,0
22990,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2018.0,"How can clicking on a screen and watching little figures walk right be an engrossing game?By making it a matter of carefully selecting and arranging those figures to get them a little bit farther, all the while knowing there is another event coming up that just might supplant everything you are doing.",1

There are a few DLC content for this game that adds character specific gear which is a nice add on to invest in, but it isn't a must.",1
22992,Crusaders of the Lost Idols,2018.0,One of the longest clicker games i'v ever played especially with all the recent updates especially the Taskmasters as well  as the variety of ways you have to use your crusaders in formations and you will eventually have to use all of them in various strategies. Especially when not being able to use your favorites in missions.,1
