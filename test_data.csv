2701,"=Old Review, 2014=  Great primarily WWII era military game. with Aviation, ground units, and eventually naval units as well. Overall fun to play.=New Review, 2016=  All I play at this game's current state is Jets.  Not because jets are better, or more balanced.  That's a total joke.  I can't really think of any plane or tank that has its real life performance accurately portrayed in the game.  Then again, I only play jets.   Jets as in a general term.  I own pretty much the entire US and German air tree, some Russian, and British jets as well.  So I fly F-86/CL-13 Sabres.  Which, are underperforming in regards to their flight models.  Germany also has a GDR MiG-15bis, that does not perform as well as its Russian tree counterpart, the MiG-15bis.  Some could argue that it's Russian bias in a way, as nearly every game I play, Allied pilots scream about MiGs being a 'point and click adventure' and being overpowered.  This is also not true.  Recently the N-37, the 37mm cannon that the MiGs carry ingame, recieved a nerf.  They 'spark' on almost every shot, and fire at a lower velocity compared to its, still relatively slow, previous version.  Getting kills with MiGs actually takes some skill to use, and if the children that only fly F-86 played with MiGs, they'd cry that Sabres are overpowered.   Nothing in this game is truly balanced, and there's doubt that it ever will be.  I have been around since 2013, and logged about a total of 4000 hours ingame (played it before it was on steam), and every plane and tank has seen changes over the years. And will continue seeing changes.  Yes, there is a real Russian bias.  You can see this on the forums if you dare to go there, or just ask any player.  But even Russian vehicles aren't IMMEDIATELY overpowered, just because they are Russian.(well, maybe in tanks. Russians club anything atm that isnt British, but that's just because as of this post, British tanks are still in CBT, so the only people playing them PAYED to play them, including myself)I still recommend this game, because it can still be enjoyable, if you overlook all the broken aspects.  But flying props is cancer, and jets are completely broken.Here's to hoping 2016 will help fix many aspects of this once glorious game",1

247,"Early Access ReviewWow, I can't say enough about this game.  Simple to learn, graphics are pretty basic but still get the scares across and the sound track works with the game.  The timing for the jump scares is great.  They get you into a false sense of security then out of nowhere whamo.  Then later in the game as the spicimens are chasing you the jump scares are so much worse.  Yet we all keep coming back for more?  Great game and the price is better.  I would gladly have paid $10 for this game, however it was FREE!  1000 rooms, jump scares and a great story too?  Can't beat it with Michael Jackson's dead hand.",1
9881,"I read a few of the reviews and honestly it seems like people just want to hate on it. This game is a brilliantly built game, leveling is honestly fun, plus the 3 dungeon re-do allows you to hone your skills and rank up each time. Early level players get given some great gear and late level players are able to earn fantastic gear just by doing dungeons. PvP may be more geared toward ""pay to play"" but honestly you can dominate with enough skill. Play safe and smart.",1
2021,"Stunning visuals, addictive mechanics, and neat functions. Path of Exile, at first, is a solid experience, especially since the game doesn't cost a dime, and sports ethical microtransactions. No pay to win here, which is a big plus in my book. Path of Exile was meant to be the Diablo 2 successor that I've always dreamed of... but is it?The first playthrough, as previously stated, was solid. The character progression tree is intimidating at first, but can be mastered over time. Skill gems offer a neat twist to the tried and true ""Diablo"" formula. There's plenty of strategy to implement here. I thoroughly enjoyed the standard difficulty.But where did it all go wrong?The second you beat the first playthrough, it all goes downhill. ""Cruel"" difficulty is terribly unbalanced. You will breeze through regular enemies, but once a rare or unique enemy appears, you are promptly one-shot-killed. Heck, even a select few normal enemies can one or two shot kill you. Regardless of how you die, you will lose 5% of your experience on this difficulty. This function is archaic, and fundamentally flawed, completely and totally. Diablo 2 did this, except the game is 15 years old, and 15 years is enough time for game developers to realize ""yes, players hate this, and it kills progression, and thus, the entire gameplay experience"". Grinding Gear Games didn't get the memo, it seems. Regardless, once this penalty kicks in, the game becomes a sluggish, boring grindfest where you struggle to level up in the face of unbalanced enemies and ""cruel"" penalties. My desire to play was crushed once I was met with this awful formula. As an insult to injury, your elemental resistances are reduced by 20%, which makes one-shot deaths even easier.Due to this massive difficulty boost, you REQUIRE a build to survive. There is no free reign to design your character anymore; you must now look to the net to guide you. Unlike the first playthrough, progression is limited to this, and the experience is totally drained out and dried up because of it. Progression is a massive part of what makes this game and others like it fun, and with this unnecessary and poorly implemented slippery slope added, it becomes entirely tedious and stale.... a grindfest (and it isn't even a traditional MMO). It essentially becomes a game like Dark Souls - a game for masochists. A game where you have to throw an unnecessary amount of time, effort, and research into it to enjoy the bare basics of the game. To even scrape by.These are the reasons why I do not recommend this game. The beginning showed LOTS of promise, but once your first playthrough is up, there's no point in continuing. There's no compelling story, no memorable characters, and the first playthrough,the Dark Souls-like gameplay is mediocre at best, and rage-inducing at worst.Thankfully, I didn't spend a dime on this gameplay-flawed package. I hope you don't spend any on it as well.",0
12535,"♥♥♥♥♥game. Cars feel like driving through a foot of water because when you turn they don't respond nearly like they should. I have a DFGT and have played other racing sims, such as iRacing, Project CARS, Assetto Corsa, etc. I don't claim to be the best at them, I suck pretty bad actually. But this game just flat out doesn't feel right at all. The steering response is simply horrible.On top of that, setting my DFGT up so that it would actually work properly and give me 900 degrees of steering in this game was a royal pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I've had no problems in any other game with this wheel, but in this game it literally took me 30 minutes just to figure out how to get 900 degrees of steering, and the solution was to disable the hand animations, which speaks to the poor quality of this game. Don't waste your money, if you're going to buy anything in this game, get iRacing and buy things in that instead, it's a much better investment.",0
8341,"I like the game and it's very good and entertaining...but why the downvote?First of all the limitations.Character limitations:You have 8 classes(one more coming) 12 races and you can create only 2 Characters/account,if you want more then of course you can buy for zen for real money and even some races are bound to real money.At least 3 slots were ok.Skill limitations:You have a lot of skills and even a Paragon path which gives you more skills BUT you can use 2 ""at will"" skills 3 ""encounter"" skills 2 ""daily"" skills and you have 3 ""class features"" from which 2 are passive so doesn't count.So in total you can use 8 skills from many?... hmmm 26(trickster rogue as example) and these are wthout the passives.Auction house limits,is limited to some quests about which I have no idea where to find and how to solve or wtf is about...Second the graphical glitches...Start playing with Great Weapon fighter and you will see what I am talking about.Many times I cannot even pick up things instantly(Except for the premium loot which you can open with premium key which you can buy for zen which you can buy f real money)sometimes I leave behind precious loot if I am not aware regardless the fact that I used ""F"" several times on loots before moving on.Sometimes the quest indicator dissapears because some quests dont have indicator so you have to figure it out what you have to do with minimal information and there no short quest if you understand what I mean.Third part and the lastIngame support sux there's no GM or anything...I wrote 2 tickets about different issues and I got no answers.Tutorials lack and boring.Character progression is boring due to the lack of skills and their visuals,what I mean here some classes have many nice and well designed abilities spells,you actually feel the class and some are boring and dull(See Ranger vs Great weapon fighter)Dungeons often are rushed by high level players who one hit the bosses and no fun in this,you cannot experience the dungeon.You just follow them as a puppy.No Steam Community market.These were the con now the pro:Great visuals,sounds and details.Lore is captivating.Dozens of events .Exciting classes and gameplay in the beginning.",0

3886,"I have one very specific complaint now.The new concept for matchmaking absolutely destroyed my TF2 experience. Introducing the forced BO3 format for casual games with an obligatory map voting afterwards drastically shortened the average game span. And most of the people leave after their map finishes because usually something else is chosen in the idiotic voting.Games are short, and people rotate like strangers in public transport.Now why do I hate this? The old TF2 was unique to me in that when I went into a game, probably on a server I knew and had in favourites, I could meet or make some friends or rivals. And the rivalry has been the key concept of TF2 since its 2007 beginning -- might I remind you the nemesis system and how well all the cosmetics and taunts fit into it by making one's appearance memorable and intentional.In the current environment it's near impossible to get personal, because the games are simply too short for any love to be able to bloom on the battlefield.Everybody feels anonymous, there is no reason to try build a team spirit if I'm going to be playing with different people 3 minutes from now. ""But Marekk you old ♥♥♥♥, why not go to a community server if you like them so much?"" Well tell you what, community servers are dead, and not without help from the official servers' availability. Of course, official infrastructure is a blessing. And it was working perfectly well for a long time before this new matchmaking arrived, and it was great.But what did we trade that for? The god awful meaningless badges that you can tap on in the menu to make a funny noise?i feel like we're all strangers now in this game... ;_;",0
5496,This game is awesome. I play it on my smartphone all the time. And that's my problem with this game being on Steam. This is a PC I'm writing this review on. I'd rather play the full WOT game on it instead of a mini version designed for my smartphone.,0

123,"Early Access ReviewI LITERALLY THOUGHT THIS WAS A KIDS' GAME. I really did! I thought all the positive ratings were parents or kids, otherwise the parents should've been mad. But, when I played the game, the jumpscares made my heart all pumping. And my first encounter with the ghost? I exited the game. Yep. I was breathing heavily, and I felt light-headed. Really, this is my first ACTUAL experience on actually trying to play a horror game. And I really was actually going to faint. I'm guessing this is a player's first experience with playing their first actual horror? I dunno. But that ghost really did scared me. NOT SPOOKY. But the one who actually CHASES you. I was frightened. This game is awesome. It summons up the atmosphere so suddenly.And the guy writting the letters is being to much like as if everything had to be romantic.

3362,"Early Access Review My First ""TryHard"" Review  Because This Game Deserves It! Firstly, I'm a hardcore game hopper, because I find flaws fast that drive me away from the game. A lot of games to date push out a title that is there just to make quick money and lacks creativity, replayability, and polished gameplay mechanics. There are also those games that go so hard into realism that it makes a ""game"" overwhelming and tedious. Luckily for those interested in a new Battle Royal, this is not the case! Off the start, I was AMAZED by the character customization. It is so innovated and gorgeous, followed by the music tracks in the background, are outstanding. It actually pumps you up! Lets get down to the brass tax.PROSGraphicsCreativityMusicCustomizationSmooth GameplayShooting down someone that is trying to escape, when there are plenty of seats on the chopper to evacuate the remaining players!!!The evacuation mechanic itself is really an awesome ending to the match, not just ""Winner, winner, chicken dinner."" Its called trying NUBG..It is not overly complex, and the attachments auto-install is super nice and smoothWhen prone, (and this is a goodin') your character actually swivels his/her body, in order to do a 360 and turns on their @$$ in order to face 180. Tired of getting that ankle caught on a twig in NUBG? Here is the solution!Snowboarding, Hang-gliding, Mountain climbing..Choosing a spawn location before the match, not just jumping out of a plane with someone's testicals on top of your head as you land!weekly and daily tasks/challengesSmoother than any BR out there to date, which is sad for this game is so new! (Great job Devs!)A true FREE TO PLAYCONSThere are graphical detials that still need to be polished, such as the structures, I.E. doors.Lack of graphical customization in settings (will hinder amount of players able to play the game with potatoe PCs)Still being developed, so bugs are eventually going to work themselves to the surface (Bound to happen)People are still playing Fartnite and NUBG, and not this yetLookout BR genre, we have found an instant crowd favorite! Just hope the Devs keep up with this amazing title!!  R-I-P  Fartnite and NUBG!Download this game and enjoy!",1
4256,"Do not play this game. the game itself is really amazing, well done and really enjoyable but konami really failed this time. it is free and this means that you can play without spend money and this makes your deck's building time extremely longer, i spent personally 30 days (playing hard) to create my ""free deck"" but the point is that for this kind of deck you need skill. you can get the skill by defeating the legendary duelists in game. now, after 49 days of duels vs legendary duelists with a very high average of scoring point 7-8k (8k is the max), I don't have the skill yet... and it is not buyable or obtainable by increasing lvl. moreover, the ultrarare and super-rare drop rate is ridiculous, even scoring 8k of duel points vs a lvl 40duelist. I scored the max a lot of times and I've even not seen a single super-rare/skill for the most of times.people play the game to have fun, for hobby and to pass a good timec.. in my opinion, 79 days to create a deck (and I am work n progress) are definitely too much. is not fun anymore.moreover 3 packs cost 2.29$ and every pack contains 3 cards (for the digital cards is insane) you cant even buy the exact card or skill. konami should increase the drop rate and the skill obtaining process to make this game consistent and funny. i kown their aim is make moneys but this make the game annoying. you spend money ok = create more deck and faster, you send no money = no competitive game (ages of tme to create a consistent and effective deck)just to let you know my stas up to date: 79 days of playing (most in android), 3824 duels, almost 20k of diamonds used for deck. > (no skill?!?! seriously?!?!)",0

If you have already played some Wargaming game (""World Of"" series), Space Conflict or WarThunder, the UI and control is quite similar. Gameplay are fun and require teamwork and strategy more than reflex and mindless actions. Having high ping or lagging didn't really affect what you could do to contribute to victory, since some ships have autotargeting weapon and ability and ship movement is not that fast so you could still play fine. I have only played the Conquest Gamemode, the map is divided (or instanced) by sector rather than one big open map. You could still see what happened to other sector and see what your teammate could see though. Moving from and to sectors is done by ""Jumping"" ability to forward base in each sector or to your home base. This makes up for the generally slow paced gameplay inside the sector, making it faster to reinforce pushed friendly sector and helping pushes faster.",1
2085,"TL:DR: The best, most fair and truely real free to play-model out there. New League will start in december - be part of it!There is no xp-booster, better weapons or all this ""hidden"" pay2win-items in the store.

Now you might think: well if this is so great free to play it must be a trash game because other companys tell us again and again, that they need the pay2win-shops to be able to sustain a good game. It's the opposite:Path of Exile is a fantastic game. Extremly difficult and challenging. And it get's more love from it's developer than most other games do.

Every 3 monthes a new League get's published.The developers are heavy connected with the fans and completly open about everything. There are news, roadmaps and much more on a daily base.Since it's free: why don't u simply try it yourself?

It's about EW business model and how they are greedy.Some companies choose to sell a full game at a full price and then charge for DLCs (Guns, equipment, cloth bundles etc…) separately. Other companies prefer to make monthly subscription system; you will pay monthly to have access to a full content game. Both are okay. However, some greedy companies like EW choose to do both at the same time whit the same game. Of course, nobody is forcing you to pay, but you will have a limited experience even subscribing monthly. You subscribe monthly and then you need to pay for every single piece of equipment you want, if you want to have a full experience. It isn’t monthly subscription enough?

7862,"NOTE: Disregard the negative pseudo-reviews complaining they haven't been able to play Trove.  The queue issue has been fixed, increasing Trove's player capacity TREMENDOUSLY.  It only took them two weeks to overcome what seems to be one of the most major hurdles Trove has faced.   I've been playing this game since Closed Alpha (over a year now) and I must say...  Half a year of two updates a week and then another half a year of one update a week - with CONTINUING weekly updates - this game started as an amazing concept and progressed into a fully involved Voxel MMO that is epic beyond words.  There's adventure, collection, combat, community-content, wings, boats, rollercoaster-rail-things called ""MagRiders"", regular mounts, flying mounts, and all of these things come in immense variety.  Not to mention it's limitless openly-supported modding capacity.With procedurally generated worlds based on an increasing number of biomes, the adventure is practically limitless.

17464,"I played this at launch and many times off and on.  For the most part get into a guild, ask questions, and know that this is almost pure PvE.  Pros: F2P (Free to play), huge world to explore (map shows you general level ranges but not all), great crafting system albeit tedious (you feel like you're actually apart of the creation, until your 200th pristine something for that next level on rush orders), many classes to play, and pretty active playerbase.  The playerbase isn't that bad I've found.  The guilds I've been in had helpful people in it and its a relief to not find trolls in  the community.Cons: A lot of grinding, the queue system for dungeons doesn't work (for ex. you could be queued for 4 hours, get the queue  and it only brings in one other person...Also, I queued with a party a couple times and it split us into different dungeons so 2 went into one and the other 3 went into another...yea.)Repeditive.  If you bring up other classes you're going to go through the same content over and over.  You'll do this because if you go to other content you'll get much slower xp and leveling in this game is slow.  Many people multi-box, mentor their other toons they want to level and aoe zones, which screws the other people in the zone actually playing their toon.Parties are almost non-existent until level cap.  For a multiplayer mmo...I for one want to group with other people.You have to pay to unlock certain races / classes.  This is to be expected in a F2P model though and for the most part didn't effect me.The pvp in this game has many issues.  First the pvp is on a different server, the queue system doesn't work very well and its usually one team dominating another as there's no balancing level wise.  Some level brackets noone queues for (most actually).I can safely say the queue system not working killed this game for me.  I don't play mmos to be alone especially when leveling up but if my past history is any indication, I'll probably go back to it at some point.  If you haven't tried it and you liked EQ1 or quest based mmos you should give it a try.",1
17426,"EDIT (2/1/15): I just found out about something called heroic characters. This is a great feature for where EQ2 is in its lifetime. It allows you to pay to get a level 90 character of any class/race along with appropriate gear and 320 alternate advancement points. You don't have to pay to try out any race/class combination. There is a try before you buy option which lets you play for as long as you want with that class at level 85, but once you reach level 86 the character becomes locked.Since the strong point of the game was always the classes as I stated in my initial review I think this is a great opportunity to give EQ2 a try. You'll be able to experience a lot of different classes and explore a lot of the world. I plan to play this off and on until EQ Next just to see some of the lore and great locations the game has to offer. I am changing my initial review. I definitely recommend jumping in and just exploring and trying out the different classes for free at level 85. I'll continue to post updates to this review on what I actually think of the content.Original Review (6/21/14):EverQuest 2, the sequel to the best MMORPG of all time. For me this game came out at a bad time because I was still heavily into EverQuest 1 so when I first played it I found it so different that it made it hard to like it. It just didn't feel like EverQuest; the classes were extremely different and the agro and combat system was different. Looking back, this is to be expected and is probably a positive now, but at the time I couldn't get used to it. I ended up playing EQ2 for maybe a month or two past the free month and got close to level 40. It was fun visiting old zones from EQ1, but they didn't resemble the zones much and some of them didn't connect like they did in EQ1 so it made it even more confusing expecting a certain zone to be nearby and it wasn't.This is a review for EQ2 in its own right though, not a review of the transition from EQ1 to EQ2. Since my initial time with EQ2 I did revisit the game on multiple occassions and it continued to grow and continued to get better. The zones are really interesting, but don't quite have the charm of EQ1 zones. I like the combat, but I could never get into the agro system where NPCs are grouped together. The art style I found to be ugly at times, the game has some weird blur effect to it. The class system is great and honestly is the sole reason I would recommend playing this game, to try out different classes. The housing system has also gotten really good over time and even though I haven't really taken part in this aspect I've toured some homes of friends and you can do some pretty impressive stuff. I have no experience in end game with EQ2, but like EQ1 there is a dedicated few still active and I'm sure the lore is top notch like EQ1 was.If EQ2 would have came around a year or two later I may have been really into it, but I think it was released too early when I was still into EQ1, and ultimately EQ1 is the superior game. I am impressed with where they took EQ2 over the years and some of the stuff I've seen looks really cool, but I can't recommend this game due to my lack of experience with it so I can honestly say I don't know everything it has to offer, but I will say what I did experience was pretty good. It won't be that difficult to jump into EQ2 because it is more up to date as far as MMORPG mechanics go, so should be a smooth transition if you choose to try it.I would recommend skipping this one and looking for EverQuest Next sometime in 2015 (probably), it looks to be doing really good things in the MMORPG genre.",1

I had five dwellers in the same room ALL WITH GUNS and they couldn't kill it. When it finally left, I figured it would be over, but NO.

The complaining about it has been unreal, but not justified.- Neowiz + Community Managers has been super quick with fixes, fixes including stability fixes, server fixes, random bugs, class balancing and much more.- Neowiz is listening to community and has  given us gifts for ""messing up launch"" which they had no reason to do.All in all, I do believe the game is worth it, or atleast will be.

4993,"When I first reviewed this game, I was way too critical about it. I think I need a better explaination for my feelings.As a strictly Rivals of Aether fan, I feel brawlhalla is very watered down. I feel like there is only 10 ish real characters in this game due to all weapons having the exact same moveset (like one sword character will have the same moves [aside from sigs]), and because of that I feel zero connection to any characters. I think the artstyle is lazy having all the characters have the same exact body template and its weird that everyone is as light as paper, even the rock character is light as a feather.I also don't like how most of the cast is locked behind a paywall but I can forgive that due to the game being free.I don't like competitive  play for this game, its just a bunch of ledge camping and it feels really boring; however I could see why some brawlhalla fans would like it. So now you might ask, why would I give brawlhalla a thumbs up if I have so many complaints?A. Because its a partygame at heart and its great at being oneB. It's freeC. I respect the fact its simpler to bring in more players.Its a fun game to play with friends on a friday night.",1
17468,"Satisfying combat, fun progression, best in industry business model. Can't really ask for more in an MMORPG. SOE knows their stuff.

And as someone whose watched this game from infancy they're just adding anything flashy to their game to get you to pick it up and spend money trying to deal with their massively grinding progression system.They've made most other forms of play irrelevant beyond tanks and fighter planes. Bombers don't have armor in this game. The so called ""fleet"" is nothing but destroyers and patrol boats--for how long that was in development and how little was produced is an absolute disgrace. Tanks development, testing, and implementation took far less time and released with full blown trees for each of the different body styles of tanks: light, medium, and heavy.And they're already moving on from adding ships to adding helicopters?! But you know one this game has always had at its core, the microtransactions are surreal and as much money as people get conned into buying because of the horrible grind in the game makes it such that they should have plenty of cash to make a whole game of World of Worships inside War Thunder.From the beginning this game looked great, the more its matured its lost the vision it started with.

I've tried them all extensively (I guess around 200 hours in each is enough to judge ~ Most of the time was in the non-steam version) And Smite is the one that leaves the most awe and a lasting impression. The game takes on one of my favorite themes, Mythology and brings the gods to life in a blood-soaked battlefield. Ever wandered who would win in a fight? Zues vs Hades? Perhaps you like spicing things up with Greeks vs Hindu gods? Chinese vs Mayan? Some Norse as well, all is possible in Smite. The game looks and feels great, the voices are well executed, the ingame prices are very reasonable considering you get free ingame currency simply for logging in or participating in certain events.Highly recommended to all fans of Moba games, even to those unfamiliar with the genre as it takes a different perspective (3rd person and moves with WASD, with attacking and aiming being all skillshot based)",1

2797,"In its current state [2018] its not good,recently devs have continued to add vehicles to the game, and botch job fix some ballance issues, instead of properly fixing what is already in the game. its a real shame because WT has such potential, however its pulled back by idiotic design decisions on the developers part.Pros: good visuals, wide variety of vehicles, reasonably good damage model design.Cons: issues dont get fixed, unballanced gameplay, terrible communication to community, idiotic methods of 'balancing' vehicles almost pay to play at high BR, unrealistic in many ways, RNG based, extreamly expensive premium vehicles, bad 'net code' [almost always over 100ping], stupid flight model when damaged, moneygrab vehicles, refusal to use some valid sources for historical information [e.g hunnicutt], etc.-moneygrab vehicles: when gaijin makes certain countries at some BRs difficult to makes players want to buy the new   powerful premium vehicle or buy premium time to win slightly more often and to reduce grind. [e.g. Ru251, XM1]-unballanced gameplay example: M1 abrams vs Leo2a4, Leopard has better armour, gun, speed and a repair cost that is   6430sl cheaper than the M1. currently the leopard doesnt have a turret ring so its horrizontal cant be disabled. gaijins process of adding and fitting in a vehicle:1. add vehicle that looks cool.2. german players complain its either underpowered or overpowered depending on if its theirs or not.3. gaijin both changes the BR and changes stats of the vehicle, e.g. increased repair cost.4. german players at the vehicles new BR complain again.5. more changes to both BR and stats to make germans happy.6. either its overpowered or too bad to play without getting depressed.7. gaijin leaves it in a semi broken state.8. gaijin adds another vehicle.-results in vehicle having unrealistic stats, fighting the wrong era of targets or be unplayable",0

7004,"Like everyone else I played Hearthstone for a long time and like many who did, I wasn't really too happy with the direction it was heading, particularly due to the ever increasing randomness on cards. Legends tones the randomness way down, though some will argue the prophecy system is still too random, while simultaneously having a lot more depth to it. The introduction of the shadow lane, where your creatures can not be attacked by other minions until the next turn, is one of the best ideas they've come up with. It adds a lot of strategy to the game and makes it so that your big guys have a reasonable chance to survive a turn, which is great if you're like me and enjoy just slamming down big dudes. The card is art is the best I've seen in any cardgame, although the board is a bit lackluster and I'm hoping they'll introduce new boards as we go along. Overal definitely recommended.",1

For me, the original selling points were:Classes being different, allowing for different kits to be used.Forging and chicken trophies being the only way to get end-match gear.A second chance to come back from death, albeit only in a team setting and only a slight chance.-The first two points were completely destroyed by recent patches, and the chicken speed boost with faster recover time means that their ""downed state"" is now actually faster than their ""fighting state.""The only pros left to the game are that it doesn't have building (which I don't feel strongly about either way), and that it is free to play. That being said, there are other FTP options, and I'd suggest checking those out instead. The devs haven't listened to the community, and now their game is dying quickly.",0

12562,"Having spent some time around the various racing sims, I can say this is not the most realistic, not the best looking and not the best feeling (Force Feedback) sim out there. But currently it's my favourite,The game is free, but you have to pay for content like cars and tracks. Considering that you probably will have a few favorite rides and some favourite places to race, you don't need to buy everyting, and with that in mind the pricing is reasonable (just buy a points package and get the content you are interested in). To get everything you have to spend a significant amount of cash, but it's still cheaper than playing iRacing or something like Project CARS / Assetto Corsa with all DLC considering the amoutn of content that is available.Now for the game itself. The graphics are good, though not mind blowing, but considering that you will be focused on turning that wheel and operating the pedals, you will forget about visuals fast. The sound on the other hand is the best in the market hands down. Handling is fairly realistic, though not hardcore difficult like rFactor 2, with good Force Feedback once configured properly. Though it is possible to enhoy the game with a controller, a wheel is highly recommended.Now for the sweet parts - contrary to other sims, there is a good combination of cars and tracks. You will not see stuff like 1 car per class or useless roadcars that go slow and spin out all the time - no Ferraris and SLS AMGs, no drifting. This is all about racing. And racing is good. The AI is one of the better ones, so you will not get divebombed by crazy maniacs all the time, and the difficulty setting will accomodate players of all skill levels. Not the best AI in the market, but quite good and most of all fun,The bad stuff? No night racing or rain. Not really a big deal, since in other sims these types of races a cool to look at, but mostly hard and frustrating. Perhaps the biggest issue to me is the lack of a dynamic racing line, where the track rubbers up in places where cars drive and you have more grip there. Not really a problem, but once you try something like this in rFactor 2, you do notice it other games. Raceroom also lacks open-wheelers and does not have many classic cars, but that is to change soon. Another thing is a full flag rules system is still to be addes at some point.All in all, of all the new generation of racing sims, Raceroon seems most fun thanks to a good selection of cars and tracks and good AI. If you are looking to get into simracing this is defo the game to try. Other sims might have better graphics or laser scanned tracks, but not the AI Racerrom has nor the amount of actual racing content we see here. ",1

11765,"Early Access ReviewWell having played the game for only a couple of days, I can not give a comprehensive review.  I can however speak regarding the the more constant complaints.   Take them with a grain of salt.  The people complaining seem mostly hung up on things that I do not see.  Crying that the game is too hard now because they nerfed damage output is chief among them currently.  Having played the game before and after this change, I can say that the game was far too easy before the change, and if I am honest I still find it quite easy afterwards, but at least players need to pay attention now, previously short of playing blindfolded it was not challenging at all.   Another common complaint is optimisiation.  Again I do not see it.  I am able to play the game cleanly on medium (3) everything with 50-60 fps @4k.  This is better then I expected given that my video card is a r9 390x, and typically takes a dump playing with 4k resolution.  If there is a point to this babbling it is this.  Unhappy people cry and complain, satisfied people don't.  Keep that in mind when reading the complaints.  Hopefully the devs do not cave too much to the criers and ruin the game trying to appease them.  Not everyone wants everything handed to them, not everyone wants to go from lvl 1 to level cap in a day, but the people who do are happy to vocalize how much it sucks when they can't.  There are balance issues pvp wise from what I can tell, and there is content that still needs to be added, there is work yet to do.  Thats why they call it early access, this is to be expected, but thus far most of what seems to be wrong with this game is the people who play it.",1

Perhaps they are upset that they cant fly or use a flashlight? (Both which come with the pro account) I played a while without it but decided to upgrade to help support the game.As people have said, Creativerse is a lot like minecraft. It's also a lot more though. Instead of crafting normal tools such as a pickaxe or an axe you make cells. Each one helps you dig further and further into the ground until you come to the final ""layer"".You unlock recepie's by crafting other items. (Make a wooden fence and you unlock wooden gate and stone fence for example.)Instead of cows, pigs and sheep you have weird monster like creatures that you can tame. Once you feed them they will produce items which you harvest with your cell. Then you must bathe them. Rinse and repeat.Of course, like many newer games there are a few bugs. You need to keep your tamed monsters in the stay position. If you let them wander they may dissappear for good.I would give this game an 8.5 out of ten.

Ingame store is pretty much useless since you can have access to all weapons in game and all you need to do is to accumulate money by killing enemies.

Better crafting system, creature language system your character can learn and speak, amazing Player/Guild housing system, an in-depth character leveling up system and more! Spend a few days learning the game and playing it and going through all the ""Advanced Options"" and menus and really dig deep into this game.

14901,"Early Access ReviewWell, I'm sorry to say that the developers have managed to wreck what was one of my favorite games. 1. The new battle mode is lame. I am not interested in blasting cubes off of towers. I want to engage enemy bots. Yes, I know that is still ""part"" of the game, but is should be the only part. I think it would work much better to simply have zone control based on sole occupation of areas (similar to world of tanks). Also having too many modes has caused crazy long que times. What used to take 5 - 20 seconds to join a match, now can take 15 minutes.2. The developers have decided that components that are higher tier should not be placed on lower tier bots. This has essentially ruined all my bot designs and makes the game (bot design and game play) very cookie cutter. It doesn't balance game play as much as it creates identical builds due to fewer options.I will NOT be back to ROBOCRAFT. Way to turn victory into FAIL. ",0

11909,"Early Access ReviewI would recommend that anyone who wants to play this waits a while for them to get all the issues ironed out.  This is only based on my own expirience but the lag is terrible, took 10 - 20 seconds from key press to actualy execute and it crashed after 15 - 20 minutes. I have had some good laughs watching other players clip around vanishing and reappearing.  There are also translation errors, in the tutorial for berserker it asks you to mount the fury and confession skills which are actually anger and fighting like killkeny cats; the second makes absolutely no sense.  My 1050ti shouldn't be having any problem running this game on medium. Game looks good and I really hope that the server issues get fixed soon, but to think that they will magically be working by tommorow like some of the positive reviews suggest is crazy.",0
7681,"I really can't recommend Trove. It's a massive grindfest and little else. There's a lot of variety in visuals, but the core gameplay is extremely basic and if you play for 10 minutes you've seen just about all the game has to offer in gameplay mechanics.There's an absolutely silly amount of cosmetics to be found, and I can appreciate that they are largely cosmetic, for example there are hundreds of different mounts, but there are only ten or so that are truly unique in some way, and those unique things only very rarely give a gameplay benefit. All the hats and faces and weapons are randomly generated, and you can wear any style you've obtained previously over your equipment, so an ugly hat with good stats is easily covered up.However, all these visuals don't solve the main problem with the game, that being the awful power creep and scaling issues. Progression has changed a lot since release, but basically at this point you are going to be opening RNG lootboxes hoping you get good gems that push your power level high enough to get to the next tier of content so you can get better gems to get to the next tier etc. until you get to the last tier and content ends. Not that there's new content at the last tier (or the three tiers before it), since the game recycles all the content it has through all tiers. Tier really only means how big your numbers are, the enemies and gameplay don't change. Many classes simply have the playstyle of ""Point at enemy, Hold M1, Tap M2 / 1 when you have energy, Tap 2 whenever it's available"" with nothing more than that. It gets old fast, and having to pay cash or wait for extremely rare drops to unlock new classes is the pits.Plus, because the game has been running so long, the economy is set in such a way that buying endgame equipment from other players is far less expensive and strenuous than making it yourself. You can spend days trying to find and collect all the materials you need to level up your equipment, or you can just buy it from someone else. I spent weeks and several thousand flux trying to build up my gear myself, and I got to where the stuff I needed to make myself stronger was unobtainable because I wasn't strong enough yet. That's some bad design. When I finally caved and went to trade chat it blew me away how trivial it was to just buy what I needed rather than go through the designed methods to make them yourself. I mean, Trove is just Minecraft with less building and a MMO skin. You can mine and craft and build but nothing you build really has purpose. The cornerstone aspect is nice, being able to have your own personal chunk of land you can teleport into the world, and I've sunk many many hours into decoration, but it's all for cosmetic purposes. I enjoy seeing what other people have built, and there's so much that people have built. There are guild worlds that people have clearly spent significant amounts of time building, and there's so many people playing that you can always find something new that someone has built.I'd say Trove is a children's MMO. It's simple. It can be fun, but after a while the fun dries up and only the grind remains. It's more of fast paced and exciting than Minecraft is, but that's not too hard to accomplish. If you really like Minecraft and want something similar, Trove is a decent pick, but it's just so shallow. It's a good game if you don't want to think too hard.",0

9231,"TL;DRA unique experience, no other game does combined arms this well at this scale. Has a VERY steep learning curve, but it's definitely worth it.Still an absolutely breathtaking game, more than 5 years after release. I implore everyone to at least try this game! I owe some of my most amazing moments of gaming to PS2.Contrary to what many people say, this game is not remotely pay to win, at least in infantry combat. Your starting weapons are great, any weapon you can buy are side-grades. They affect your playstyle, but don't give you an advantage in every situation. There is a point to be made in vehicle combat though, as some (arguably) must-have weapons have to be unlocked, such as rocket pods. Luckily though, every weapon (except for the fancy decorated ones, which have no benefit over the regulars other than looking nice) can be unlocked with certs, this game's free currency.There's something here for everybody. Like tanks? Oh we got tanks alright. Like flying? Sure, you want a bomber, fighter or transport vehicle? More of a hit 'n run type? Try the Buggy or putting a grenade launcher on your quadbike! As for infanrty, the light assault allows you to scale walls, the infiltrator can cloak and snipe, the heavy assault has heavy hitting weapons and rocket launchers, it's all here.  You'll hear some people say there's no reason to play any other class than heavy assault, but this is simply not true. Yes, the heavy is capable of taking and dealing the most damage, but this is pretty much all they can do. If you learn to master the other classes, you'll be just as much of a threat. An infiltrator, for example, can sneak around the battle and start hitting the enemy from behind unseen. Take advantage of your turret near a chokepoint as an engineer! The possibilities are endless. However, it will take you a lot of time to figure out what the best option is in any given situation. Many players, however, are willing to help. Don't be afraid to ask questions about anything! Take note of what others are doing and try it yourself. If it's not working, that's not your playstyle, and you should switch.",1

And everybody has Panzerfaust or stuff like that to destroy APCs instant.- Weapons are incredible unbalanced.It always takes such a long time (month or years) to convince the DEVs to nerve stuff.- This game is OVERENGINEEREDToo much troll Stuff for Troll Players (PTRD, swimming vehicles and whatever)- Snipers and Campers EVERYWHEREeverybody wants to be a sniper now and is hiding behind those plants.In earlier versions there where not so many plants. So snipers where not so OP.--> And again nobody cares about Game Mode and capture zones.- PERFORMANCE People have 30 FPS or less- Spawn Zones are pointless placed in the maps where it dont make sense.- The general/strategy part of the game make NO SENSE.in earlier versions it made sense but now in every city there are 3000 infanftry or other stuff.- Russia is winning wars because of auto resolve and nobody cares about it.It makes the strategy part pointless and will take several years until the DEVs will understand this.",0
3024,This game is very fun. At times it may seem like pay to win but with enough time you can stay competitive. I use this as a time killer and it's a pretty good distraction. All that plus it's free.,1
9613,"Honestly, I really never played this all much. At first I had about maybe 30 minutes into the game. After I came back and saw what happened with new items and such, I now have 159 hrs in game. Yeah, pretty addicting game. I would say once you get the jist of the game, it's honestly the best game. Deca really saved the game after, so it all turned well with the free gifts and the bringing back of old items, mostly just making the game better in general.Ign: Pewpmaster",1

16072,"Early Access ReviewIf you have played Artix enetertainments other games (especially AQW) i highly recommend this game to you. Seeing the world of Lore in 3D was truly a dream come true. Artix enetertainment is really determined to make this game awesome, once they decided to remodel battleon instead of just changing it instantly they did an event in which battleon was attacked and you had to defend it, this just shows that the developers want to make this game fun and available for all. They are also highly responsive to the community, many problems which was in the beginning of AQ3D's launch have been fixed from pc interface to combat bug. They are so responsive that Cysero had a debate with a player on how dwarven made swords must be broken XD. If you are looking for a quality casual rpg game i highly recommend this game to you. Have fun and as always BATTLE ON!!!!",1
1020,"Early Access Review  It was in fact the recent slew of negative reviews that first brought this product to my attention while exploring my que and got me curious as to what the hubbub was all about, then later on that same day a Twitch/Youtube streamer that I frequent started streaming the game and got me REALLY curious once I actually saw the gameplay.I think this game is a blasty blast.  It brings thoughtfully strategic AND tactical gameplay in a 3 dimensional environment to a broad genre of games that are very similar to each other.  Longtime RTS, MOBA, and shooter fans alike could all find different reasons to like this game.  The ships are gorgeous and remind me of cover art for sci fi novels out of the 80's and 90's.  (i.e. Larry Niven, Steve Webber, Isaac Asimov and the like)  If you were ever that guy that liked the idea of MOBA/arena style gameplay like LoL, Dota 2, Heroes of the Storm, Paragon, Smite, etc etc but were looking for something that slowed things down a little bit (not the length of match but the pace of gameplay) then this could be the game for you.  Add in the fact that you are piloting massive warships with kilometers long engagements ranges instead of a wee widdle Hero/Champion trudging down the same dirt path and it gets even better!  Fans of games like X2/X3/X4 that thought the world was a little lonely without other people, or the strategy gem Sins of a Solar Empire that wanted some more fast paced (and shorter game time) matches but still want to get their blowy up the space ships on should give this a try.  People who like the concept of EVE Online and enjoyed the basic pvp gameplay but got turned off by the way super hardcore community, world, etc may also want to try this out.  Hell, even Starcraft fans might find something to like in this game.  The community is dangerously small, (I hope this game makes it to full release) and the overall level of content has a long way to go before this game is ready for the masses but it has that magic spark that could could develop into something awesome.  If you want more on the negative aspects of the game go find another review, if you want to figure out what makes this game awesome just install it and give it a try.  And be patient, this isn't Call of Duty in space.   ",1

8481,"Early Access ReviewEdit; I was wrong about developers caring. They do not want this game to succeed, and thus have shot it in the foot time after time. They have failed the populous by trying to attract new casual players, who are attracted to the game already.... improve the population by retaining current population and bring in more by word of mouth... great word hirez, you had the chance to change the scene of the gaming world with an mmorpg BR  and ruined it entirely.Fantastic game, tons of potential.. DEVELOPERS THAT CARE!!!!They have released patch after patch, some bad, some good.... However, they ALWAYS LISTEN TO THE PUBLIC. They make this game a players game. 10/10 would reccommend. Come give it a shot, and watch it flourish. Many past bad reviews were for drastic patches that have since been reverted and fixed. It's alpha, they're working on making it a top game.",0
16533,"It can be fun for short periods. With the little money you will get daily (enough for a few of the cheapest payout games) you can play. You may win those games too. However to rank in a tournament you need to play higher cost/payout battles. This means you will spend hours and hours saving money if you want to try and get into one of those decent payout tournaments. That's not all, though. You will spend what little money you have on upgrading towers, meaning you are back to playing the cheapest payout game there is. So to play in any tournament you need to spend money. Once you are there, expect to lose everytime. You can copy exactly what the opponenet does (layout, boost, balloon sends, etc.) and still lose very easily. Very big pay to win game. So if you are ok with that, or with playing a few cheap games per day max, then this is ok.",0

15015,"Early Access ReviewFirst off, this game has good mechanics, and it runs smoothly on even bad computers, thing is, th server connections can cause you to freeze in game, dragging your mouse cursor to the middle of the screen and prevnting you from canceling or retrying a connection to chat, thats right, the chat servers are virtually required to play the game, otherwise you sit theere racking up points for the jackass guy at spawn. secondly, in order to paint your robot with primary colors, like red or yellow, you either have to get  lucky enough to catch a premium promo code or gmail event, or buy  premium, on top of that, the teir  system is god awful with inexperienced or just low level players getting their asses kicked by pro players with top teir bots.The original game mode, which i liked, was a simple 2 team deathmatch, where you dfid not respawn, and it was fight to the death, thats gone, The AI training area where you fought in arena against AI players in a ffa, gone. replaced with a 2 team deathmatch where low level players get one team and high level players get the other, and you sit and get killed for 15 games in a row until you can scrounge up enough exp and crap items to get a slightly less pathetic bot created.Skill is usually not as much a decider as how many shield you can tack onto a bot, and weapons come down to how many can you spam at the enemies shield, the only skill requiring battles are ground V Air battles, or vice versa, where aim and flight skills trump pure weapon and shield power.Those are the downsides.The game has a diverse selection of maneuverabilities, including flight, treads, speedy wheels, legs, spider legs, rockets and tomarrow, propellers.Weapon systems are interesting with high power gravity effected plasma, to low power smg spammer, to high power sniper rail guns, to low power healing beams, to high power blades, to low power... you get the pointShield geomatry allows for the optimal weapon and surface area coverage, with tons of shapes to choose from.Curved blocks, slanted blocks, blocks, glass, helium, uhh, corners, slanted corners, smooth corners, etc4 colors to choose from (barring premium colors) Light blue, Orange, Grey and white. <thats some amazing customization right thereuhh, sounds that happen when you do stuff, a Tutorial where you learn the basics of placing blocks, then you walk around, then you shoot an immobile mech guy with aesthetic paint and armor that makes you wish you weren't a total noob and had that♥♥♥♥♥♥optomized uhh, aiming system where you can zoom in, and you point at stuffAdsSee cool designs on the front cover of the game, than go ingame and see maybe 2 good designs every 10 battles that also work in combat.camping.Regenerating to full health by hiding like a wuss for 7 secondsFlagshaving friendsTotally violently active chat that makes you wish this was not sarcasmA penalty added to  you if your game glitches and forces you to shut it down at the start of a game.4 garages to build robots in!a shop.More contentand uhh... uhh...... ... ... ......... \..stuff.so you see this game is decent, would i recommend it, probably not, which why i said no, but if you do want to play this game, make sure you have more patients than a chronic AdVenture Capitalist player.Yeah.This game is ok ",0
9948,"The problem this game has is that the basic necessities like skill slots and skill tree resets have to be bought for each individual character.

1554,Early Access ReviewIf you are tired of being in a fighter and looking at those giant capital ships and wish you could fly one then this is the game for you.

This game is on its deathbed with barely anyone playing in oceanic, and worldwide for an mmo. Wish i refunded in time.Wait a while and see, can't recommend at the moment as gameplay is not fun, no action combat except for beserker, and even then it still feels like tab targeting. Currently wait this out and see if devs can figure it out but with most EA games, its gonna take a long time. Technical issues are also present , with constant frame drops and at even the lowest of settings, barely able to keep stable 30fps, only getting 60fps in some areas. Translating is pretty sub par, in fact so bad in some areas it seems like no english speaker has even proof read it. Store isnt Pay to Win , but it does follow every eastern mmo with its irl money to skill change tokens, and with currently most skills either poorly translated or not currently working/ bugged a bit, gonna cost you a bit just to try them all out, for a game thats 30usd / 50nzd with potentially a 15 usd sub, definately a poor choice.",0
2988,"This game is absolute trash, and a truly disgraceful showing from the creators of one of the most prolific WWII flight sims of all time (IL-2 Sturmovik).Being roughly cut from the same cloth as other flight sims, it's hard to explain to those not accustomed to the genre just why this game is a freemium disaster. Let's put it this way: if War Thunder were a tactical FPS with a realism bent, this is what you'd get.SKILL - PERCEPTION: Research upgrades to increase your character's ability to spot targets in the field. Starting level: one eye. Level two: 8/20 vision in your single eye. Level three: basic visual acuity in your one eye. Level four: SECOND EYE ACQUIRED! Level five: You're no longer legally blind! Level six: You no longer need glasses (technically). Level seven: You can read!SKILL - STAMINA: Research upgrades to improve your ability to walk more than five steps without collapsing in a pool of your own vomit.SKILL - WEAPON HANDLING: Research upgrades so your character eventually starts pointing his weapon in the right direction.SKILL - AMMO LOADING: Research upgrades to increase your bullets' muzzle energy. Level one is equivalent to the speed of a muscle-propelled rock.SKILL - GUNSMITHING: Research upgrades to increase weapon reliability! Level one: handmade in a Columbian sweatshop out of string cheese, gorilla glue, and old socks.Imagine playing a typical FPS where everything you do is made to be as outrageously sucky as possible unless you grind hard to fix it. Yes, you are terribly gimped (to a completely and insanely unrealstic extent) unless you dig around this game's grind-sink ""research"" tree, meaning no matter how good you are at flight simming, your ""character"" is crippled by nonsense like this.Your plane will handle like a brick with wings, in kind, unless you LEVEL UP. And this is a free-to-""play"" game, so you know what that means! Yep, the game is an absolute, insufferable grind designed to bleed you dry. The carrot dangling from a stick is the prospect of playing an actually decent flight sim with real, live human players. The reality? Your ability to compete is objectively crippled unless you pay to get your artificial stats to some degree of parity with other players.War Thunder tries to conceal its miserable grind sinks under a veneer of ""realism."" You see, your character needs to build up his tolerance to G-forces. That's why if you make the slightest attempt to turn, you lose all control of your ship! Of course it makes sense. And of COURSE you need a *level whatever* *blank,* otherwise your plane will overheat, stall out, and generally fall apart the instant you engage in combat above cruise speed.I'm sure in WWII they made planes out of rusty scrap and threw 400-pound diabetics in the cockpit. That's why this game is so true to life!It's free, so you've got nothing to lose by trying it. All I'm trying to do is keep you from wasting your time. However, if you do find the game to be an obnoxious mess of a cash grab, like I have, I implore you not to judge the Sturmovik series too harshly. The *real* games in that series are nowhere near as terrible as this is.",0
5459,"Meh.. it's a nice game but I think that having the World of Tanks that is the real PC version would be better.

4618,"This game is continuesly compared to League of Legends and Dota 2, and for good reason. Though generally looked at primarily as a ""League of Legends"" clone, Smite actually takes a different approach into game mechanics and especially p.o.v ( point of view) where as League of Legends and Dota 2 work out as a more linear top view design, Smite does in a third person persepective where you can see the areas around your ""god"". Now for the game mechanics it's pretty straight forward with w, a, s, and d as your movement keys; 1, 2, 3, 4 as your skills; mouse 1 as your attack and mouse 2 as a cancel key; and e, and f as your ""relics"". Like League of Legends and Dota 2, itemization is key into first learning how to play and the roles are pretty similiar( in the ""competative level""; a solo laner( usually bruisers), a mid- laner( usually a mage/ range champion), a jungler( usually an assasin type or tanky and can initiate), an ADC/APC( generally range champions but can be magical damage based as well), and a support( generally with hard crowd control, peel, or initiation/ disengage). The community may not be as big or as widespread as others it is compared to, but the one it has is strong and continues to push updates, patches, and changes ( mostly positive) to the game as a whole and I wish it continues to do so as HiRez ( in my opinion) does a good job in making sure the community interacts with its developers. Overall I'd give Smite a 8.5/10.",1

476,"TL:DR The new update annihilated the game, don't waste your time until the positive reviews start coming back.The long version is that the game had some minor balancing issues, it played less like a clicker game and more like a macro game until you got to higher zones, when finally your clicks mattered to how much damage you'd do. Additionally, Attack Speed was a little broken since (as far as I know from how far I got into the game, about zone 40-45) you could only get attack speed with Spirits, so you'd spend your spirits on Attack Speed and get Damage and Gold Gain from leveling your girls to level 200, 400 or 600.Taking this minor balancing issue into consideration, the devs decided to murk the entire game and put it into an unplayable state, your clicks matter more and you're able to use an ability to essencially get 100% crit chance (crits now do x10 damage instead of x2, HOWEVER the ability takes 30 minutes to refresh) but now leveling the girls gives barely any damage, and your click damage in the mid to late game is dependant on the damage of your girls (You gain a % of their damage towards your clicks). It now takes hours to defeat some of the earlier bosses that you'd previously be able to beat your first or second try after collecting a small amount of gold.The only positive thing I can say is that it's nice that the damage your girls deal to the enemy isn't 'chunky' anymore, and now the enemy health bar slides down. Legitimately the only positive thing I can say.",0

5405,"The usual reason to play WoT Blitz is to speed up waiting - be it on the Porcelain Throne, on a bus or in a queue. Now I can add 'just for the heck of it (without using BlueStacks)' to my list.After 826 battles, I've unlocked:Chi-Nu, Japanese Tier 5 medium tank,AT-2, British Tier 5 tank destroyer,SU-85, Soviet Tier 5 tank destroyer,KV-1S, Soviet Tier 6 heavy tank,Leopard, German Tier 5 light tank.I was initially very impressed by others bouncing dozens of shots off the armor of the KV-1 and decided I must also have it. The Soviet heavy tree has been a boring grind for the most part though with the only exception of the T-46 (tier 3). The KVs are very slow and virtually blind. It's a lottery if you'll manage to position yourself for a few hard-hitting shots and absorbing a good amount of damage or you'll getâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥from behind by a Leopard within the first 2 minutes. The KV-1S was incredibly weak until I got the best gun for it (costing 20k experience), but even now it reloads so slow that a single miss can mean I'm more of a burden than a boon to my team.The British AT-2 is the closest you get to cheating in this game. In a battle where you're the highest tier and you manage to keep enemies off yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥and shooting at your front you'll quickly ruin the other team's game. It has 203 mm of frontal armor, which would be good at tier 7 (you're tier 5). You're going to sacrifice speed (it's really-really slow) and view range, so you kind of still depend on your team to scout baddies out for you, but this is probably the easiest tank to steal the show with by shrugging off thousands of points of damage and destroying most of the enemy team.The Soviet TD line has been pretty much okay all-around. SU-85 has a nice low profile for hiding behind rocks and hopefully making the enemy aim a bit too high and miss.German light tanks require skill. A masterful Leopard can punch much higher than it's weight, but it's also really easy to speed into a group of enemies and get killed within 30 seconds of the start of the battle. It's an okay tree to unlock, but nothing that exhilirating. German TDs are quite enjoyable, especially the Hetzer with it's small frame and very well angled armor plates for bouncing off shots even if you do get spotted.Surprisingly the Japanese tech line has been by far the most fun for me. I chose the light branch (Ha-Go, Ke-Ni, Ke-Ho) winning 62, 61 and 50 % of the battles respectively, being 'productive' in each battle. The tier 5 Chi-Nu is on the useless side starting out but also quite good when fully upgraded. What made the light Japanese tanks so fun was that I could reach any mountaintop, their small size (all stats being equal, a smaller tank is better) made almost any bush viable for total camoflague and guns with high maximum depression angles and fast reload times enabled me to keep shooting almost every second of the battle. Shooting opponents is the fun part of WoT Blitz and the Jap tanks offered lots and lots of this.I think it generally holds true that the higher level you play at, the more boring it gets. At Tier 6+ everyone's pretty much a veteran, knows all the sweet spots on the map and punishes any mistake you make harshly. Battles where you can kill 3-6 tanks on the enemy team via sniping cleverly are pretty much behind you by then. So I think it's fair to recommend playing multiple low level tanks instead of focusing hard on one.Why I generally like WoT Blitz:1) Best time killer app I know - kills lots of it without getting boring, difficult or whatever, effectively a time machine when waiting at the dentist's for example2) Very short match queues - I don't want to queue while I queue3) Progressing through tiers of tanks feels good4) At least for now, no-one cheats, almost no-one pays to win5) I get to learn tank names6) A lot less of a cl*sterf*ck than the original WoT for desktop",1

Not only that but all the parts and ammo you can buy to make your gun perform differently are going to need constant credit infusions to keep working. Don't leave now theres more!

3073,"I would love to recommend this game but simply can't anymore. Multiple reasons this game has gone down the tubes because of a company that simply doesn't listen to its community.1) Community is ignored by Gaijin.2) That ignoring leads to things like terrible economy/maps/credit earnings/pay to win structure/ etcOn the topic of economy you may as well shoot yourself in the foot from the beginning. The reason why Youtubers who play this game with higher tier vehicles do NOT show you end game screen results is because even they know the game needs an RP increase yet refuse to show how much grinding it takes to earn one module/ tank.It infuriates me that this game has gone down the tubes so much in the last few months to the last year. With the addition of tier 6 all new and upcoming players have basically become ignored in every facet of the game. RP at low tiers used to be able to earn you a tank in less than 1-3 games depending on how well you do. With RP gains the way it is without premium players could expect to take upwards of 360 or more games to even earn a tier 6 tank with the RP gains currently. Since the average tank match takes more than 10 minutes you can expect to take upwards of 60 hours just to earn a single tank.In short, I love War Thunder, you are a great game. But I can no longer support a game in which puts its 1% and less than 1% of the community who already own top tier vehicles and can spend the time to grind the game the way they do. We will never see Gaijin fix the game unless they have an epiphany and realize that the main reason this game is losing popularity is because of the terrible support and mechanics you give your community.EDIT: Still a pretty awful game. Game engine was updated yet performance is slowly dropping. Game basically favors those who already have top tier. Forums are full of non-helpful people who if you could look up their account from the forums would basically have every vehicle in the game. In short its becoming an elitist community with a dwindling population and updates which don't announce changes like the recent drop in Silver Lion earnings which wasn't announced and dropped on all vehicles premium/talisman as well. They are becoming an increasingly greedy company and it's becoming confusing that they don't respond to the community basically at all.",0
6930,"Played many hours on the Bethesda launcher so my hours played is inaccurate. Big fan of ESL and in my opinion is currently the best CCG at this time. It's very similar to Hearthstone as many point out, but personally feel like it improves on a lot of aspects over HS, certainlly more tactical and is less RNG-based card-wise.- A free story mode with custom decks and choices which reward you with different cards. One of the strongest points in the game, and one that I prefer over the solo adventures from Hearthstone. New story modes are paid for, unfortunately, but from what I've seen, these modes are a lot more interactive compared to HS' quirky straightforward adventures.- 50 cards and up to 3 copies of non-unique cards mean more dust/soulgems needed, but only 1200 for legendaries. The game is quite generous with it's packs however, and rewards come quicker and more frequently ie 3 win rewards- The Solo arena along with the multiplayer arena. The Solo arena is great, and feels like an extension of the story mode where you face AI, but they tend to have an advantage in various ways and have themed decks- The lane system is a welcome addition. Usually there's a standard lane which is a normal lane and a shadow lane where creatures basically have stealth against attacks (except spells) and you can't attack across lanes. This feature means a lot more strategy is required on creature placement.- The rune system is something I have mixed feelings about. On one hand it makes the game a lot more tactical and calculated instead of going all-face all the time, but card draw isn't too rewarding - which is where prophecies come in. For those unaware, each player has 5 runes and breaks for every 5 health increment, and each time one is broken, you get a random card draw; prophecy cards can be played for free if drawn this way. It's extremely satisfying getting a prophecy, but with 50 card minimum decks, it's super RNG-based and is just inconsistent. - The class system and flexibility with cards is a welcome addition. A lot of freedom when it comes to deck building.- Beautiful and consistent art and design, a lot more intricate and mature - very similar to MTG artstyle.I'm writing a review to support this game as it deserves more attention and a larger playerbase. Underrated game. ",1
5426,"I've Played somewhere around 2.000 battles in - ( May just call it the original WoT ) and I can't say I'm too disapointed with this one... The system requirements are really low and the casual way the battles play out seems pretty suitable for just ""a quick game"" maybe before school / work.  There could of course be more vehicles and maps in the game, but I would say it still makes a decent ""little brother"" of the original WoT.  Now despite what the hardware requirements say, the game ran pretty much flawlessly on a 1.80Ghz single core cpu, 3GB of RAM and a 1GB graphics card, getting 58-60 FPS almost the whole time using the highest preset and no AA.  And to people talking about some ""horrendous paywalls"".. you can actually claim a premium account for a couple of days for FREE. I currently have an IS (tier VII), a Matilda (IV) and an SU-85B (tier IV) and a couple of lower tier tanks that don't really matter and I've played 70 hours so far, where in the original WoT you would probably be still stuck at some tier 3-4 without a premium account. Also you don't lose credits by playing the heavy tanks as in WoT i actually wasn't able to pay for the repair + ammo resupply costs thus resulting in having to sell my IS and go back to low tier tanks just to be able to still play the game. Of course you could just pay some real money to get back into the game, but that sort of becomes a damn ""Pay2Play"", which is not suppossed to be happening in a free game.  Now you would be right saying that I was probably an avarege or even bellow averege player, but I had decent performance in every battle butI always gained around 2-10k credits for a win and lost around 20-30k for a battle that you lost - now mind that I wasn't using nothing but a gun rammer to reduce the loading time to I think somewhere decent. And that obviously isn't going to result in any huge profit in a longrun.I would recommend you playing the original WoT though, Its better in many ways for players that are actually into the game and want to improve.",1
14583,"Early Access ReviewI haven\'t been the most avid player in thus game but I have ahd the game since close to it\'s first release. The game used to be sooooo good. The best part was the currency, the better you play the more you\'re paid. Now it\'s this stupid cycling parts thing. You get nearly no cash, and it\'s killing the game. Please make it the way it was before, I don\'t want to see this game crash and burn. There are so many pros to this game, but that one MASSIVE con is outweighing them all. I beg you, please go back to the way of earning cash that WORKED, which was the better you play, the more cash you get. In it\'s current state i cannot recommend the game and honestly not a lot of people are. Dear DEVS, if you truly care about this amazing game, you will fix this.",0
16492,fun game lots of guns one big problum some guns cost so much xp and xp is hard to get and some guns you have to buy with credits but still some guns are realy cool for a small price and the games is free so 7.5/10,1
2954,"Started playing Warthunder 1/1/14. At first it was entertaining but after 2 weeks of playing it lost it's appeal. I really shouldn't have to submit myself for hours upon hours of tutotials on youtube and reading message boards to understand the game let alone have success at it. I purchased a premium membership and nothing changed. Everytime I get shot down it's by a guy 2-3 tiers above me in a vastly superior plane. Matchmaking needs to be better (I.E tier 2 fly against other tier 2's) but it appears that's not of concern for Gaijin. Since I work and have some semblence of a life then apparently this is not the game for me since I require another three months of watching youtube video's and playing to even begin having success. There are dozens upon dozens of bad reviews regarding this game and all are centered around the 1.37 update which made me realize that it wasn't all my fault as to why I wasn't having success at this game. The comparisons to a ""hedge fund"" and ""ponzi scheme"" are accurate and I'm officially boycotting this game until these issues are fixed.The concept is great concerning the vintage WWII planes. Soundtrack and graphics are also appealing. Flying for 2 minutes then getting shot down by a higher level plan of which I stand no chance against......is not.I purchased the premium membership 3 days ago, I'm walking away from the game and Gaijin can keep the 2700 golden eagles I have on the account.",0
6387,Early Access ReviewI can't recommend this game just because there is so many issues that  ruin the game.1. the tanks are just so annoying spawn killing you from miles across the map with Cheap♥♥♥♥♥ammo it ruins mathes2. they incrased the anti tank ammo cost so not only will you lose money trying to take a tank out but it cost 100x the price of a tank shell.3. hit boxes are joke they say it server lag your computer lag blah blah blah. However I can only beleive that so much espically when you shoot point blank range and AIM down sight with your smg and fire 15-30 rounds yet only about 7 actually detect that not lag that bad hit boxes.4. Hit boxes again when you hit someone they magically take no damage5.leveling up to get gear/ unit since last build is a joke I mean it will take something like 1 million xp to get from 12-13 with an average of 3k if your a good player per match will take you months and thats not even last level6. Maps can be one sided depending on what lanes are open 7. anti tanks mines are just stupid on how they are used you sneak up behinde a tank plant a mine run away and shoot it(assuming you actually got up that close without getting shot at)8. Lack of anti air planes can domiate maps at times because inf don't have anything to take planes out expect AA guns which do very little damage.Now there are good things as well but till they sort out the major issues in the game i say avoid Espically the hit boxes one the rest if you play smart you can get around it. However the reason I left was due to annoying hit boxes which they claim is no issue it is just server lag. ,0
5665,The worst game i had ever seen in my life. I don't know how this idiots designed this game.

5996,"If I had one word to describe DCS it would be rewarding. You start off knowing nothing but eventualy with a lot of studing you start to figure things out, you learn how to start the aircraft, how to fly them, how to fire weapons, and how to dodge missiles. This game is not for the faint of heart though, you have to study ALOT for the more detailed aircraft in order to even be able to get off the ground, but if you dont mind studying and you love flying I would suggest you try this game IMMEDIATLY.",1
12438,"Another great race game, especially online.....its well supported and well managed too.  There are lots of leagues and its pretty easy to get into.This is another racer that I play exclusively in VR and its really well optimized.  Its not as pretty as Project Cars 2, and doesnt have the eather effects, but it really doesnt matter.  In my oppinion its the race physics that make this game what it is, oh and the unmatched audio.  Its a sim racers race game, and with a force feedback wheel, its really does drive perfectly.  The base game is free, so just try it and see how it goes......youve got nothing to lose.  If you do like it, it can be pretty pricey to get the extra tracks and cars.  I'd say wait until there are sales or offers, and get what extras you want then.  The WTCC and DTM racing is what this game is about for me, and worth every penny.  If you want to get into sim racing, try this game...like I said, its free, and thats gott be worth it, but be warned....you might just like it! 9 outta 10",1
3269,"Early Access ReviewIt's the best Battle Royale game for me! I tested it since March, and I was looking forward to it all this time.Even with asian servers during test ping was almost OK, and with NA servers now it's very good.We're waiting for EU servers.",1
4849,"Just going to start with saying that this is my personal opinion and my experiences with the game. Other's will have different experiences and opinions of their own.I played this game quite a lot when it first came out years ago before steam. I bought the god bundle because I liked being able to play all the different mythological figure. I enjoyed different take on a moba style game and loved the mythology angle of it. Unfortunately, the longer the game is out the less fun it became. It reached esports level and people started dumping their lives into the game. I play MOBAs very casually and don't take them very seriously. At this point, the game is almost unplayable in a casual way. Bot matches are a terrible waste of time unless you just want to try out a new god you've never played before. The bots are so bad at the game that it doesn't even give you a good feel of how the god actually plays though. Outside of bot matches, the majority of the games I join, I end up against a clan that clearly plays the game a lot while I end up on a team of randoms with no coordination what so ever. The other team will just steam roll through yours and not even be taking the game seriously. It's not really an enjoybale game when 5 minutes into the game your team has 1-2 kills while they are in the double digits, they destroyed half your towers, and are now just farming kills for fun. You can't surrender until 10 minutes and they are fully aware of that. Once in a very rare while, you'll get into a normal game without any clans and it can be pretty enjoyable but those matches are far and few between. The only way to really enjoy the game is to play it seriously and focus on it as your go to game. You pretty much have to find a group of people to play the game with and really only play it with them. Of course there are going to be players that are good enough to carry a team but for most games, it's going to be a matter of the group coordination, planning, and communication like any MOBA.The real issue I have with the game is that casual play doesn't exist because their either isn't a skill based matchmaking system or it's just a really horrible one. I'll maybe play this game once a month to try out new god released or try out a new event but it gets worse every time I come back. I don't know why they think it makes sense to put clans up against completely random groups in their non-ranked play. There are plenty of clans in queue, why can't they get matched together and random groups can get matched with random groups? And of course like most MOBAs, the community is pretty toxic. You can expect to be insulted and trash talked by the clan that just wiped the floor with your team at the end of the match because it was too ez for them. I can jump back into HOTS or LoL, queue up and typically get into a game with people of similar skill and at least have a chance at winning most games. I don't have time to focus all my attention of this game and following the meta to have the perfect build with the right team to run the perfect play against another team on a regular basis. If there was a way to conitently queue up and not end up against an organized clan, I would probably play this game more and actually be able to enjoy it again.TL:DR Don't bother with this game unless you like incredibly stupid bot matches or getting steamrolled by clans in unranked casual queue. If you love MOBAs and you have an organized well communicated group to go into battle with you, then my review doesn't really apply and you should give it a try. If you are looking to play it casually, then you really should pass on the game.",0
11828,"Early Access ReviewDespite the haters the game is actually fun. The combat feels really fluid and fun. Once they the balancing issues are fixed this game will be amazing. I've been playing since the 28th with 6 of my friends, we're having a blast. The game has more pvp and pve content than BDO for those people who hate on this game and play bdo",1

2699,"♥♥♥♥ this game. It's gorgeous and addicting. The grind is extreamly long and many of the vehicles aren't balanced or historically accurate. The models in the game are amazing looking as is the customization. The game is massively frustrating as many people (not just I) go round after round of being killed to never achieve anything. I once played 10 rounds in a row of just being slaughtered, no kills, no captures. Being sniped from accrosed the map in Tier 2-3 games before I could even do anything. I want so hard to like and enjoy this game and it instead makes me want to throw my monitor acrossed the room. To counter point, I have had rounds with many kills and capturess, they're just few and far between. Having played most FPS' since the early 90's, I'm experienced enough to know when a game just isn't worth playing. Sorry War Thunder, I'm done with you.",0
6174,"Early Access ReviewSo I downloaded this game to test it out, but it just popped up code 35 and when I looked up what code 35 was turns out it is a ban for cheaters EVEN THOUGH I NEVER PLAYED THE GAME",0
2499,"The game is very realistic and fun, but there are certain tanks/ aviation lines that are at an extreme disadvantage compared to other nations and need to be reworked/ balanced. My recomendation dont play american tanks unless you want to spend 90% of your play time in your hangar or getting one shot right at spawn by German, Russian,British, or Japanese tanks. The American tank tree is outgunned and underpowered at tier 3 to 4 compared to other nations tanks and unless you play realistic battles and manage to flank a German heavy or medium tank like the Tiger II or the panthers or any of their tank destroyers you will find yourself getting blown up instantly while only plinking rounds of of the front of these tanks and other nations vehicles.",0
1429,"Early Access ReviewReminds me of Hawken with Capital Ships.  Very fun game and I can't wait for more features, ships, and weapons to be added.  Great idea to make it F2P... now keep it that way to maximize the server population!",1
7061,well 300 hours in game I can say that its fun but hella annoying n more or less all have to do with luck u can make good decks but still wont help u win if u get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ draws but still fun The dark brotherhood maps good n worth the 1000 gold each but dont spend real money its not worth it lol. in periods game wont load until u try many times n game can be unstable at times. u can pay to win but Ive not spent any money on game but still got all the DB maps and madhouse collection missing a couple decks so if u are pantient its not that hard to get. The seasonal reward cards are good but think its dumb u can forge them before theyre given as reward. kinda kills the fun. some cards too op n if u meet an opponant with too many of these u have no chance. Id recomend it unless u get your day ♥♥♥♥ed if u lose too much cause expect that to happen in periods n u will notice that the resistance from opponants differ very from what time a day u game but that goes for most games xD,1
2791,"So, I've put 1,586 hours in to this game and I have a story for you. I kill this one plane going down then I get shot at by someone else. He kills my engine and almost my pilot, so I have no power and control, but I see 3 planes in front of me, so I kill 2 of them and about to kill the 3rd plane and I get shot down by a friendly AAA gun. This game was so nice back at 2013 or so I saw on videos of Long5hot, but now it's so broken that game it's getting more and more worse by the day.So don't try to tell me that this is a good game, because it's not at the moment. The P51D was added back in 2013, I think. It was broken then and still broken now. Don't even get me started on the Panther 2. I can't recommend this game with the way it is right now.",0
1027,"its really sad how this game ended. This game was really amazing. Great gameplay great ships great visuals. If it was 1 year ago i would say buy but sadly it isnt. Queue Times are like Endless Space 2 Games... Endless, literally. This game just slowly died to not enough players. No real singleplayer mode make it pretty much unplayable. I dont think that anyone is still playing at this point. So great game and thumbs up but still dont install it",1
14595,"After coming back to the game after a long while, I'm happy to say that the game has been improved alot. However, it still isn't even close to as good as it was in 2014. Lootcrates being the only form of getting building materials is gone. Actually, lootcrates entirely are gone. That's a step in the right direction. However, alot of new content has been added. This has caused alot of the weapons to suffer from a severe case of power creep, and has sadly made quite a few vehicles useless. Specifically, plasma bombers (Planes that rely on plasma cannons to do damage.) have been made nearly useless. Planes in general now have many counters. I.E flak guns, homing missiles, etc. I also don't like how vehicles can now have more than one type of weapon on them. This, again, destroys planes aswell as many other designs. Everyone and their mother and father is usually going to have all types of weapons on them. Now, everyone can serve as anti air, anti tank and medics. This is not good. It turns everyone into a one man army. My suggestion to fix this is to buff the original weapons, mainly the plasma launcher. Even for ground vehicles, the plasma launcher is overshadow'd by alot of the other, better weapons. Another suggestion to fix this would be to force vehicles to only have 1 type of weapon.The gamemodes are okayish. Team Deathmatch is your typical 5v5 first to 15 kills wins. The other gamemode (Going past league ranked, and PVE) turns the game into a MOBA. Which, I don't agree with. Why the good old 15v15 1 life only PVP mode is gone, I will never know. That was the best mode. My suggestion to fix this is to simply put the 15v15 PVP mode back into the game, as the primary mode.The removal of the pilot seat pretty much ruined combat, as all strategy can be thrown out the window. The bad gamemodes also means that all strategy can be thrown out the window. Now, instead of aiming for where you think the enemy pilot is, you just aim in the enemies general direction. How to fix this? Simple. Add the pilot seat back.With the removal of the requirement of a pilot seat, armour blocks have also been removed.  This only encourages people to spam blocks ontop of eachother, with no care put into them other than ""How much health can I have?"" and ""how big of a surface area can I get for all of the weapons in the entire game to fit onto my vehicle?"". Also, health blocks are free, so it's alot easier to spam health blocks. My suggestion? Bring back armour blocks, And if the devs do decide to let players use multiple types of weapons on a single vehicle, countermeasures should be added for homing missiles, aswell as flak. (I'm not sure how you would create a countermeasure for flak, but an idea for that would be a shield that can temporarily block nearby flak damage.) Also, add tiering back.Oh, and leveling up is way too easy. And you get 1 tech point per level. Take this with a grain of salt, as I ended up starting at level 51 because I had played back in the early days of the game, and thus, had started with around 50 Tech Points, which let me research alot of equipment easily. Bear this in mind, the maximum that I know one of the researchable technology costs is 5 tech points. Most of them are only 1 or 2 tech points to research. You can litterally kill no one, die 5 times and lose the game, and you'll still level up. And that's in the level 50s, imagine how fast you'll progress through the lower levels. I know this because I wanted to see if I'd actually level up like that. Which, I did. To fix this, as you probably assumed, make it harder to level up.The main good thing isn't about the game itself, it's about the developers. They actually will read a good portion of the reviews they recieve, hence why I'm going into detail about each of the main problems that the game faces. In its current state, I would not reccomend it. However, I would keep an eye on it, as the devs may fix alot of the current problems, due to how they respond to criticism in a positive manner. It may just be that I'm looking at the game through rose tinted nostalgia goggles. As the devs said in a dev blog, ""There's no 'revert to 2014' button.""",0

Also If you would like to get started you should try out the Primal Burst pack and try Gem Knights. A event called tag duels is curently underway and should eventually become a permanent part of the game and will be added to pvp, right now they are testing it out with this event. Something I forgot to mention is that this game is always doing a event, which is a very good thing.

15676,Early Access ReviewThis is one of the few if not only game I have seen that does crossplatform right. You can actually play with other people on different devices and not restricting you to one platform.  The art style is unique and the characters have depth to them. The monsters are nicely done and interesting. I also like how the devs listen to the smallest detail that players want. Artix Enterainment is a very passionate Indie dev studio. You can expect some crazy things from them. Another thing I like is the fanbase. Everyone I met was nice and are just as passionate as the devs.The game kind of gets repetive and i hope they revamp the rewards you get to make them more like um...rewarding. The crafting seems weird i'll have to see what they do with that. The game is in a simple state. pretty barebones but from what they are planning they have really big ideas for this game and I hope everyone of them gets fulfilled. EDIT:  with the new edition of the greenguard revamp the game looks like it will be less repetive and less grindy as they continue to revamp all the older areas that were once a grind fest. Being grindy is one of the most common complaints this game has so seeing them trying to fix it gives me more hope for this game.(will continue to update this review as more major updates come out.),1
11043,"Early Access ReviewAs an MTG fan who didn't feel like spending 400€ + to even be competetive / creative in Hearthstone and who didn't enjoy most other digital card games (sadly Magic: Duels had an insane amount of bugs and crashes for me) I gotta say that this is definitely the game I'd recommend the most. It's the perfect mix between Hearthstone and MTG. Keeping the simplicity of HS alive while also allowing for Mana management and a lot more indepth tactics and card / deck combinations.It also doesn't feel like I have to spent an insane amount of money to be competetive. I've gotten a lot of free packs and cards so far, the campaign gives you legendaries for every color and you get a good amount of currency. Also pretty interesting gamemodes. Definitely recommended from what I've played so far. Great game.",1
12932,"  This may be one of the best Free-to-play games on smartphones in my opinion, and here it is on Steam roughly 2 years after the original release. With its gameplay being building rooms and later upgrading them for more resources for your Vault (somewhat similar to something like Clask of Clans in that way), upgrading rooms (and even rushing them) do NOT require Nuka Cola Quantum (aka the games ""premium currency""), instead, rooms will upgrade the instant you purchase it with the games basic currency, Caps. The mechanic to Rush rooms to get the resources instantly is a great idea, and it works well in the game! Basically, rushing a room has around a 30% chance of failing, and it increases by +10% each time you do it, the counter will go back down to 30% if you allow the room to work naturally. If the Rush fails, there will be a disaster in the room (ie a fire or a Radroach infestation), if thats the case, the Dwellers (more on them in a second) assigned to the room will have to douse the flames/fight off the radroaches. For the Dwellers aspect, you must rebuild civilization by allowing dwellers to become members in your Vault. Each Dweller has a set of S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills: S for Strength, P for Perception, E for Endurance, C for Charisma, I for Intelligence, A for Agility, and L for Luck. Dwellers high in strength can work best in the Power Generator rooms, which are vital for powering your Vault. Dwellers high in Perception  work well in Diners, which supplies food for your Vault. Dwellers high in Endurance can work well in Storage rooms. Dwellers high in Charisma do well with, well, talking; Charisma only affects males/females conversing with someone of the opposite sex, which will end up causing the female to become pregnant and after 3 or so hours will birth a new child, which he then grows up to become another worker in the Vault. Dwellers who have high Intelligence will work best in Medbays or Science Labs, where they can produce Medkits and AntiRadiation Packs. Dwellers high in the Agility stat can work well in the Water Treatment rooms, which supply water to the Vault. Then Luck affects the Rush mechanic, allowing the chance of a disaster to go down a little bit. Strong Dwellers are also very capable of venturing out in the wasteland; giving a dweller a weapon (which helps them during Radroach Infestations or Raider Invasions) will allow the Dweller to survive in the wasteland, out there he can find Caps, guns, and outfits (which will help stats for Dwellers) and return them to the Vault. Combat in the game is simplistic, Dwellers will automatically attack threats and fight fires, its your job to heal them though, if they wont survive, you can assign them to another room so they can flee and survive. If they die, you have 24 real life hours to revive them with Caps, which can be handy. When you reach 18 Dwellers, you can build the Overseer's Office, which allows Quests to be unlocked. Quests are like sending Dwellers out into the wasteland, except you select 3 which meet the Quest requirements (i.e. level and weapon power) and you send them to a certain location which can take anywhere from 1 hour or 21 hours in real time, to speed this up you can use Nuka Cola Quantum. When they arrive at their destination, they travel as a group and will fight enemies. However, combat in Quests is VERY different from regular battles in the Vault, and it is, in my opinion, a little hit or miss. If Dwellers walk into a room where there are enemies, they are locked into fighting and cannot flee (I learned that the hard way), so if you intend on doing quests, i strongly advise packing tons of Stimpacks. Aside from that, combat is a bit deeper, it's still simplistic, but you can tell which Dwellers should target what enemy, and there's a random chance a checkmark crosshair will show up above an enemy, which once clicked, pauses the game and enters a timing minigame where you must click the crosshair when it's as close to the center as possible, doing so will give a critical hit that's 5x more powerful than the basic attacks. Quests do, however, offer a chance to score tons of loot that can be used later in crafting (which I myself have not reached yet).Side Note: if you've played a Fallout game, you will most likely recognize a ton of familiar aspects of the game. As the game, in my opinion, stays very faithful to the Fallout franchise in terms of style and presentation.If you enjoy Fallout games or Free-to-play games in the style of crafting rooms and ect., you will most likely enjoy this game, whether it be for Steam or smartphone. I give it 4/5 Stars. If you do plan on playing this game, I hope you enjoy it! ^u^",1

WHY NOT?/?// why i must to farm every day ♥♥♥♥ing dragon coins and flux, materials. it's too boring. gems are separate story, 70 ♥♥♥♥ing chests i need to full up karma bar for stellar gem and not 100% chance that this gem will be with 2-3 stars.

Why i want to play this game, i like this game, but cos of i dont want to play this game 24/7 i can't be good player which can go to ultra shadow tower with other good skilled players and complete this dotm. One more thing, 2 years ago i've believed that Shadow Hunter will be good character, cos for that time it was bad, i though that glyph will change stats, BUT they are sooooooooooooooooooooooo lazy and can't to invent something and they just do very high attack speed therefore m2 and 2 skills not using (skill on 1 key sometimes can be used).

2930,"Yeah, I'd recommend this.  1, It's a free to play game that's actually good,  damage caused by area of hit, possiblitily to repair, replace crew, believable enviroments.  2, It's NOT an MMORPG!!!!!3, Graphics 9/10  (but this depends on your system of course), low is pretty good quality, I play on high with frame rate of 60+, and although it says not to play in 'movie' mode, I did, and still got average of 35fps!   VERY OPTIMIZED if you ask me!4, Great system for purchases and research, yes you can buy the Golden Eagles, but play and you'll get enough RP and Silver lions, just not the premium tanks.(They're pay for items, but they gotta make money somehow!)Overall I have enjoyed this so far, okay, sometimes you get hit and that's it for that tank, but smile, watch the kill cam, and start afresh in your 'super tank'!!Go on, give it a go, you maybe surpised!!",1
2270,"Having an *ahem* history with Diablo 2 LoD, I was preparing very hard to be disappointed here. I'm very specific about what I enjoy in aRPG's, but this definitely delivers on all the fronts that I've come to like. The maps are repetitive but random (this is a good thing) and there is an obscene amount of loot to find. The currency system is different, but better (I remember vividly how useless gold was in D2 - no more). The passive tree isn't very intuitive (if you want a competitive character, that is), but it does offer a lot of potential for theorycrafting if that is what you enjoy. As far as I can tell the classic aRPG class niches have all been nicely filled. If you don't feel like theorycrafting, there's an active forum community (official forums, obviously - not the steam ones) that probably has a guide for the thing that you want to play somewhere. If you're looking for Diablo 2, but not Diablo 2 itself, you will like this.",1
1056,"This game satisfies my desire for a fast-paced space battle with capital ships. These ships are lumbering kilometre long behemoths but a majority of the ships are actually quite agile. Don't get me wrong,. When I say fast-paced, I mean specifically for capital ships and not dogfighting. A majority of space capital ship games will have you spending a minute to turn 90° while this game has you turning on a dime. The best part is, they also allow strafing.The ship models are simply amazing. They are very detailed and there is a nice variety of ships. Not all of them are 100% symmetrical as well which to me is great as symmetrical ships seem to be a sci-fi trope. You can also tell a ship's purpose just by looking at them. If you see an enemy ship with a huge gun strapped to its side, you better hope you're not in its firing arc!The learning curve can be pretty intense though. You will fall into the trap of tunnel vision in your first few games and Leeroy Jenkins your way into an enemy team's kill zone. But the thing is you will only blame yourself, and not the game's mechanics.I'm having a blast with this game and I can't wait for what they will do next. Try it out yourself. It's free!",1
12066,"Early Access ReviewThis game is just plain bad. The revemped combat is probably the worst thing about it. It feel repetitive and plain boring.The limited access to the BG and dungeon, lack of customisation when it come to skills and the empty world is just icing on the cake.At first I did enjoy the taming, I mean, you can tame prety much anything and make it a pet or a mount. But after a while noticed it suffer from bad design like prety much everything in this game. Yeah u can have cool pets and mounts, but runing out of stam on a epic mount after 3 min of riding it suck. Or after over 700 taming scroll, you look at your pet list and there none of the blue pet that rolled any usefull skills. I don't mean tier 3 good skill, I mean I got 0 tier 1 usefull skill and also none of them rolled auto loot.

17490,"An older game, to be sure, but has its own charm and holds a special place in my heart - having played it since I was young. Definitely still has some grind if you want to run through *all* of the content, but if someone just wanted to get right into the action, I'm fairly certain he or she could get up to speed quickly. Pretty expansive variety of races and classes, with few restrictions if any (evil races can play as good classes by betraying and vice versa).I would still recommend buying a subscription if you want to play endgame content (removes most limitations), and unfortunately there are a couple extra features that need to be bought outside of that, but if you buy the sub, you can collect the credits to get those free of charge anyhow. Not sure how playing free through the whole game would be, but I'm sure it's both viable and still fun.The lore in this game is incredible if you're into deep storylines. I wouldn't say the questing feels as epic as it did in the original Everquest, but some of the story arcs can make you feel like your character is the hero he or she is espoused to be. Plus, the game still receives consistent updates and I've even seen guide-run events (by volunteers or employees in game) more recently.Playerbase can be a bit slim, but when a new server launches, usually there's a ton of people who come out.If you're into MMO's, don't mind a bit of grind and graphics that aren't cutting edge, I'd recommend trying this game!",1

For me maybe because i dont have a joystick and was flying via the cursor keys, this was the only down side to the game as i had to lift the Vive head set off my face to see the key to press which when your trying to land the plane was a real pain and led to many crashes.If the VIVE controllers worked and you could grap the the joystick to steer the plane and push the cockpit dials to lower wheels, apply brakes etc this would be awesome.",1

12056,"Early Access ReviewWell, there is a ""something"" about BLESS that I really like and that got me attracted since I saw it.I think it's called ""intellectual property"". The playable races (I think it's rather species, but whatever). The idea of fractions. The good, ol' MMORPG style that does NOT try to re-invent the wheel. All that combine to what I think is what I want.I, a 27-year old, grown man, have a weakness: Whenever there is a small, playable race, I am in. Might it be the Yordles from LoL, or the Lalafell in FFXIV, or my two Asura in GW2. When I saw the Mascu, BLESS came up high in my interest. That was like 2 years ago. And a couple of days ago, I had it ""on my radar"" again. I've read through reviews that are so full of hate and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t equally, full threads of discussions on how bad it is. Funny though, I realized later, it's always the same guys echo-chambering each other. The ONE post in that thread about how nice BLESS is, had more upvotes than the others.. All the uproar about the failed start... I have a deja vu regards my GTX970, where everybody was hating' about the card and nVidia - while I was happy with my graphics card. My point? I am so far very happy with BLESS - no matter what others say.Of course, a lot is strange or awful, but it's almost immediately followed by something I really like. So far, it's like a roller coaster: + The character selection/creation is well-done+ The Mascu- The tutorial is totall bullocks: No explanation why I am there apart from ""I am hurt in battle"" or something. Then it tells me to press button X and Y. I do so. ""X and Y pressed. You know now how to fight"". WHAT? My jaw dropped in disbelief. Next step: Skill menu. ""Press Z button do Y"". I press ""Z"". ""Good job, now you changed a skill"". Me: ??? Then a giant monster is spawned, kills me in one hit. ""Oh, and this is what happens when you die. Press RESSURECT"". Such a Bull!+ After that, there is a nice cutscene with voice over on board of a Mascu airship. I really liked that!- I fight off 3 (!) one-hit (!) beetles before...+ ...Mrs. Mascu captain of the airship shows up.- Then the loading screen ends despite I still load (HDD LED flickers) for like 1 minute. During that time, I have 10fps (Ryzen 1700X / GTX1080 / 16 GByte RAM). + After this, the game is smooth.+ I am in the airship wharf and look into a nice town with ropeways that move in the distance and all that! Awesome!- ...just to see the surrounding mountains are bland - no tress or bushes. Like a fresh terraform map in CITIES SKYLINES..+ So I descent into the wharf and hear the sound effects have correct reverb because of me being inside a building+ And a light haning over a big, spinning fan in the lobby of the wharf creates a nice dynamic lighting that made the whole scenery believable.So there is MUCH to change and improve. Especially the weird camera that works ALMOST as expected but made me run off a cliff once. But so far, I got hooked somewhat. Not that much super hyped, but at work today, I really was looking forward for coming home and trying further. Can I recommend it as Early Access: Yes. The potential is clearly there.",1

You really have to communicate well with your team or just bulldoze the other ships to their HQ.

7068,"More strategic than hearthstone / More generous than hearthstone / less p2w than hearthstoneNeed I say more? Okay in all seriousness though this game is heavily influenced from MTG & Hearthstone. It's got some great innovations that the other 2 don't have such as the runes [every 5 life lost you pick up a card and a rune is destroyed] and having 2 lanes to play cards in.The interface is top notch as well, same with the cards/balance [for the most part]. The ranking system is a bit more merciful than hearthstone in that you will go into the ""serpent"" mundus if you are say rank 2 and are at the bottom of your constellation mundus. So you will have to have 2 wins to get back onto the constellation board but you won't go to rank 3 once you hit rank 2 no matter what.So in short....screw hearthstone and play this instead. Your wallet / ESO lore will thank you later. Also for the record I JUST hit legend and I only spent 30 bucks on the game cause I wanted some packs....I easily spent way more than that on Hearthstone and you still couldn't keep up with the meta",1
2129,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07B4SbJLPzk&list=PL0E56219EE956754EPath of Exile: An action RPG similar to style and feel of great titles like Diablo 2. Path of Exile is a true marvel in its approach and achievement. Everything in the game is solid and simple but with a lot of its own ideas to make it different from most other ARPGs. From the colossal sized skill tree and open ended character building to skill gems and support gems and to the land of Wraeclast itself, it’s a unique enough experience that I haven’t encountered anything quite like Path of Exile before. Its non-standard approach is a nice breather from typical tropes of ARPGs and the fact that it works so well is a great achievement.  The game not only looks great but its sound design and overall ambiance is dark and dreary and very fitting of the setting. The story and lore of Wraeclast is quite disturbing and is quite interesting to unravel although, like most ARPGs its story is more akin to a movie rather than a true role-playing experience, where you make hard decisions and live out consequences of those choices. The game also suffers a bit with regards to its own character system, in that each character can potentially be the same, it loses its replay-ability a bit when compared to other ARPGs where characters are a class unto themselves with their own unique skills and spells and the skill tree in general will take a lot of careful planning and getting used to. Overall the experience of Path of Exile is solid and fun with the most frustration coming from the fact that it is an online game and with that comes some technical issues such as lag and issues from other players themselves. Personally, I would have gladly had paid whatever the asking price for this game, for it to be single player and online as optional. As a free-to-play title it does come with its own store which thankfully I can report does not have any content within it that feels like it has to be purchased in order to enjoy the game. Items in the are generally either cosmetic items, purely for looks or things like stash or character expansions, but they give you so many to start out with that these won’t feel like immediate needs or purchases ever. Path of Exile is a great ARPG, everyone can enjoy this game and it is simple and easy to get into and play and it at least offers 20+ of content for a first time through the entire game and it’s all completely free without any extra game content being behind a paywall. -Double Thumbs up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork ",1

Once you run out of those you either wait 4 hours or, naturally, pay up. Packs only have 3 cards as opposed to 5 and cost 50 ""gems"" per pack, while the amount you SOMETIMES get as a RANDOM reward is 1 gem and 10 if you're ULTRA lucky.Right off the bat there are powerful decks that you can only by and are not available anywhere in game so ""micro"" transactions are strong with this trash.This isn't even propper Yu-gi-oh! - field is limited to 3by3 instead of 5by5 because, again, this is a ported mobile trash game so it had to fit the phone screen and there is no Main Phase 2 so if your can't even do anything like sacrificing several mosnters you used to clear the field for a single better one after you have attacked except end your turn.

1493,"I've been playing this game since late alpha/early beta. I've been active in the community, lead events, and participated in competitions. Not just a paserby that didn't get interested in anything past playing on my own.I have a very serious question. Does ECG ever plan to advertise this game? To grow a player base? To reach out and seek an actual member-growing strategy? Skill brackets in PvPwere removed because the queue times to play PvP were ungodly and caused players to quit. Arguably the worst queue times most of us have ever experienced (often 45min for a game). Now, we are able to play games after probably an average of 10 minutes (those of us a little higher) which, while nice, has had huge reprocussions.Today I played aprox. 9 games where each, in a row, I was teamed with players with much lower rank than myself. For those of you wondering ""How could you know that"", I asked most, but you get to a point in this tiny community where you recognize just about every name that's near you in rank. One that I played with was apparently on his 2nd or 3rd match in PvP as a whole. Take 2 high rank players on one team... pair then with 3 incredibly low mmr players. Now pin them against 5 moderate rank players. Who will win? Experience always outweighs. But, according to the system, I should've won by a mile. Instead I lost 33mmr. Then 20mmr. Then 15mmr. Then another 20mmr (the average is 8-12 for balanced games). Game after game because ""I should win"" with green players on my side that unknowingly throw nearly every strategy. The fault isn't with these players - they're new. The fault is with this system and the development.Every update focuses on the flash of the game. Aesthetics, events, so on. When will the priority be to advertise? To fix the biggest issue the game has had since alpha? Two years is a long time. I've been here for what seems like ages; made some great friends and had a lot of laughs. But after today and after looking at the 'temporary fix' of removing brackets rather than facing the elephant-in-the-room-problem Fractured Space has had since Day 1 has made me finally decide that while this is fun to pick up occasionally and maybe play a game every week or so... it's just not worth it to try and help make a community active if the Developing team's priorities have never alligned with player base growth.Why would this be worth my energy if it's obviously not worth the devs' energy?It makes me sad. I want to love Fractured Space. But after two years of constant avoidance of the largest issue the game has ever had and no visible or obvious desire from ECG to attack it head on or even, God forbid, come up with a game plan for the future to solve it, you found a way to cover it up. No brackets. Both low and high players suffer so greatly from this. Games are only 'games' if they're fun. A blowout or a crush is neither. In fact, that's a great way to shove every player that's been playing for years away and have newcomers be completely disinterested.Don't worry, new skins are coming soon. You'll be able to show them off to the flashy AI players they'll soon be putting into PvP.",0

7191,"I am sad to give this one a negative review, since I had quite a bit of fun with it. The thing is, it seems at some point the algorithms started stacking games either for or against me; and I do not just mean combo stuff. I mean games where you get all the high-cost cards (think maybe 5-6 out of a deck of 50-60 cards) you cannot play, one after the other, at the beginning, while the opponent gets a regular mix (or vice-versa); I mean getting only actions or only items for the first few hands, even in balanced decks. For months on end, I thought to myself ""it's just coincidence"" or ""players got better as time wore on""; but no. After many experiments with all manner of combinations, I for one am convinced that, at the very LEAST, there is a problerm with the shuffling algorithm, although I am inclined to believe what I have read in several places: the game now seems to stack odds for or against one of the players.I love the art, I like the mechanics in general and I have had interesting, challenging games with many people, but for the past three monthsd or so, I have become endlessly frustrated and hence, decided to uninstall the game, as it is no longer fun.",0

11786,"Early Access Review EDIT: Don't buy it. You know, I ended up finally letting common sense kick in for a little. I really wanted to like this game, and I really wanted to be a part of it and the community, but then I just added up all the development mistakes that have happened in the past few months during the port, with the fact that it's a game that's failed in other regions not only due to its awkward combat, but the base game itself. Yes, it's listed as an alpha game, but every other port of this type (BDO, Archeage, etc) started out as an almost fully working game, with some bugs, or misstranslations here and there. Bless started out with tooltips that make almost no sense, and bugs so severe that areas reload as you're in them, over and over and over again. I tried to push myself to play on a Berzerker (the only class with a working action camera), and I was just flooded with bugs and grindyness that it wasn't worth pushing though it. I  wanted  to love Bless. But in reality, if a game is coming to a new region, with their primary feature being a revamped and fun combat (that's not even fully implemented in the 5 classes they claimed to have adapted it to) it's just a bunch of fluff to a broken game. Maybe they'll work on it down the road, fix their laggy UI, actually implement the action camera, add a dodge mechanic to most classes that interupts animations (you'll find yourself animation locked in telegraphs a LOT), hire someone to translate their UI instead of using an auto translator (You've obtained 2level! 10% damage increase taken reduction!). If you REALLY want to try it, go ahead. Maybe you can push past all the bugs and stay on it long enough for the developers to ""fix"" it. But they'll probably just look for a new region to port it to, I hear Oceania is the new hotspot for thrice failed launches. ----------------- Original Review ----------------- The game is actually pretty fun. Surprisingly fun considering how skeptical I was from the previous releases and how shady the development was.  (There’s a TLDR in the end) That being said, there are so many issues with it right now that I can’t really recommend it. So, I’m going to start out with the bad, and lead into the good. I haven’t played it for long (only had the chance to make two characters and get them past the tutorial) but there is a lot that can be said in terms of issues from there. Here’s what I’ve picked up so far: Breakdown  Graphics 3/5  - The game looks okay. It’s not great, and it’s not horrible. It’s basically a more realistic GW2 artstyle. The skills do look very neat, and the effects are enjoyable. The transition animations are horrible. If you’re walking in a straight line and turn left or right, your character snaps in whatever the direction you’re moving without any transitioning animations. Same for most skills, sometimes it looks like your spine is breaking in half to switch to whatever animation you’re transitioning into. It’s a bit awkward to look at, for me at least.Audio 4/5  – The soundtrack is nice, but the skill and weapon effects are amazing. You actually feel like you’re smacking down with your battle axe thing when you charge it up. It has a nice feeling to it combat wise. The voice acting is pretty bad, and you can’t tell if the voice actors didn’t care, or if they used Microsoft Sam for some of the voices. But the combat sound effects were so enjoyable that I only bumped a point off for the weird dialogue audio. Gameplay 2/5 or 4/5  – I’m having to give combat two scores, because it’s not fully implemented. If you’re playing a Berserker and you’re using the action camera, along with the combos, it’s really enjoyable. It doesn’t have the same excitement as BDO does, but it’s pretty good in it’s own way. It’s some weird hybrid that gives you a sense of flow, and lets you play around with the combos to figure out how to adjust your abilities to each situation. So 4/5 if you’re playing on the Berserker. For every other class, it’s a 2/5, because you’re stuck with a clunky tab targeting system and awkward movement animations that don’t look right. They’ve -disabled- the action camera system for every other class, without even warning the players. They’re supposed to bring them back at some point, but that’s just stuff I’ve head from other players. Story ?/5  – I can’t really judge the story yet, since I’ve only tickled it’s fancy. It seems like it has a lot of potential, if it wasn’t ruined by the awkward voice acting. The developers did make use of the generic evil villain with a robe and facemask, but I enjoy that type, so hopefully they’ll sort out the translations and voice acting soon. Pay2Win (No?)  – Doesn’t seem like it is, the cash shop gives you minor boosters, but nothing that makes you mega overpowered. It’s basically pay-to-level-a-little-faster. Costumes offer no bonuses, nor do they make you almost invisible to other players. (cough, cough, BDO Ghillie Suit, cough) Summary: It has the potential to be a really good game, I’m a huge mmo fanboy and love to play new games in the genre. Graphics are okay, and the sound effects are nice, combat and gameplay is pretty fun (on the ONE class it’s actually implemented in). If all of the classes had the action camera implemented, and the developers were more transparent about missing MAIN FEATURES, I’d definitely recommend Bless Online. But, at least for now, I’d say hold on to your wallets until the developers give us a proper announcement about what’s missing, why it’s missing, and when they plan on giving it to us. I understand that they’re still working on the Mystic/Assassin, and that’s fine, but it also looks like they’re working on four other classes and forgot to tell us.  Note:  You have to edit an .ini file to remove the profanity filter, and your characters don’t have nipples. They used to, but now they magically lost them during some weird censorship that happened. Not a deal breaker to me, but the game was made T rating friendly. TLDR:  I really want to recommend this game, but until there’s some proper communication from the developers about  BASE FEATURES  that were shown in trailers and promised to us (I’m looking at you, gameplay video of a ranger “aiming” to shoot her arrows) I can't do that.  Buy it at your own risk.  This review was done with consideration if this being an early access game. The main complaints are about things that were supposed to be in the base early access game, and that were removed without any major dev announcement, in some cases without any at all.  ",0
1639,"the game itself is good, had a lot of fun. But the problem with this game is that u are too much dependable on the people u get with you in matchmaking. Apparantly you have too much people who want to play carry, and then fail at it, what results in a waste of time. It usually starts already a hero selection. People don't communicate, only play what they want to play and usually lacks of teamplay when the game is busy.Too bad, because the game itself is good, the community is for 80% flamers, egotrippers, wannabe carry players, very rude",0

It was so long ago now, yet I yearn to go back. Sadly, there is no going back, not now. I'm in too deep, I've strayed too far, down the path to Dota I go. What matters now? No, it is not joy, though I wish it was. No, no, no, what matters now is MMR, a seemingly meaningless number with a grasp tighter than any drug.

13741,"Early Access Review     I went into this not sure if I was going to like the game, but willing to give it a little bit of time to see for myself.  After the first few hours of playtime, I realised that I was hooked.  My family and I have always loved playing minecraft together and this is everything we loved about that game and then some.  We can create, we can fight, we can BLOW THINGS UP!  It allows each of us to play in our own style.  The amazing part is that this is still being tweaked and improved upon to add even more incredible things.  There are only two things that I can see on the negative side so far and those are:         1. There is no offline gameplay         2.  Characters are not modable (but you do get  a choice between being a boy or a girl)     The fact that these are the only things that I and my family can find that are negative, says a lot.  In the future, these things could also change.  We will be playing this game for a long time to come so hopefully we will see it come about.  I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone!",1

9608,"Okay, were to begin, this game has just been sold to a new complany, so if you play or are thinking of playing know it will be under further development. This game is an MMO, there is no PVP only a realm (2-5 in each server) with a maximum of 85 people all fighting events, bosses, minibosses, gods and minions to level up, better their gear and of course complete all the objective to verse Oryx The Mad God. The game is a perma death, meaning if you die, you die, and no matter how many hours you have on that character, its dead make a new one. So when you die it can be quite stressful, panic-related shock and anger causing. Having oover 1000+ hours on the game it safe to say I have died alot, quit alot and restarted alot. The idea of the game is to get loot from bosses, better the teir of your items or get UnTeired items from certain bosses that are really good. Now the game itself is quite repetetive, so if you see everything once or twice, if you keep playing you'll ebd up seeing it thousands of times (thats not a joke). Taking into consideration the game will be soon under development, expect new things monthly even weekly. I rate this game 8/10 with friends (very fun and addicting) and 5/10 without (very boring). So if you're looking to play/invest money into this game as it is very 'pay to win', make sure you have friends to do it with you. Final thoughts of this game or rating is 7/10, highly enjoyable for the most part, would spend the 1000+ hours again.",1
3692,"This is a Long review, if you want a short quick review, skip this review.....Year 4 of playing TF2.Where do i start this? Idfk, this game has made me speechless about making a review.I once make a review when i played it for 100+ Hours, and 350+ Hours, But this time i gonna make a really Serious Review about this.TF2 is Fun. Any game mode, any class, any server, It's a never ending Gameplay makes you feel like to play it more and more. Any weapons, any tactics, all exist, and they will keep growing.Community existed, and they are also keep growing too, and i am glad the community never dies even this game is lack of Consistent updates. Comnunity server is also fun if you want to play other than Valve's Official Game mode like VSH, Jailbreak, and theres many more you can explore.TF2 Competitive existed too (Community Competitive server, Valve's Version is a bit... bad.) And even Pro TF2 team & Competitive Match & Series existed too, but This game is more to Casual play, so you cant expect too much at comp, but hey, why not try it?I played this game for 1500+ Hours, and it will keep growing until i can't play this game anymore. I have played like CSGO, CoD MW2, BL2 and more FPS Stuff but i never stay in that game a very long time, and always go back to TF2.I still remember when my RL friends calling me ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for playing this game. They say this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥but they never tried it. They play more to AC, CoD, BF and more ""High Class"" FPS, and i just play TF2. Now they stop playing those, meanwhile i still play this game even i have some hiatus by playing other game.Conclusion, i personally think this game is the best Game of the best game, and never makes me bored.

14747,"Early Access ReviewThe main emphasis on this game is that you get to create and build robots with different methods of locomotion and weapons types. It's a game aimed towards the creative mind. You're given different types of cubes and connection rods to act as armor, and when they're gone, you're either done with the match or respawn at extending intervals, depending on which game type you picked.However, lately Freejam decided to make a random reward system. This system really handicaps the idea of creating things and rather than allowing freedom for the player to make what they want, the developers seem more focused on monetary gains with membership ""premium"" status and an optional crate buying system, reminiscent of  mobile games. Although not ""Pay - to - Win"" technically, it's a literal gamble on what parts you'll get. And this is what stiffles the game. It's a game that wants people to build something, but detrimentally handicaps them by giving them a crapshoot of mostly unuseable pieces. (You might get an idea to build a cool bot, but are given a ski and a China flag. And you might have even paid for it)Also, there doesn't seem to be any foreseeable endgame planned and content releases are slow/ slight variations of previous ideas. (One new map added as of this writing)Matchmaking has been addressed, but it's still lopsided at times.

3290,"Early Access ReviewFirst off this game is far better than PUBG and FORTNITE. In my personal opinion I find it takes everything wrong that is with PUBG and just fixed it. And I find its better than Fortnite cause honestly Fortnite is just a prime example of a company selling out (Refering to EPIC killing Paragon for Fortnite and then releasing 12mil$ of assets for free on Unreal just to say ""hey we're done with this, we care more about money than our work, so y'all can finish the game) but this review isnt about those two games its about this one. First impressions was superb, I really enjoy the character customization menu and the variety of clothing options you can preview beforehand. Now when I played on the beta, it wasnt a snow map, so this makes me think they will be adding seasonal maps with a variety of packs to go with them. Now the big thing of this game is the pack system which I will give a pro and con of.GliderPros: Best mobility pack ingame in terms of moving speed, you can literally glide across the map, the glock is niceCons: I find you need to start in the mountains for this pack to shine as its limited to where you can use it. Lowest capacity start off (so need to focus on finding a backpack for max carry)SnowboardPros: Can be used almost anywhere uphill and downhill, can cover great downhill distance, medium mobility and medium capacity, can do gnarly jumpsCons: You're limited to certain paths, (it kind of contricts the pro I've mentioned but its a little harder to explain, you would have to see for yourself)Rock Climbing Kit (My personal fav)Pros: Can use ice axes to quickly skim up and down slopes, max starting capacity, the shotgun is decent, zipline is motor driven so can be used up and down, can jump off early at your own risk if you see incoming threats, can cover long distances fastCons: I find the rock climbing itself is very linear and there arent as many rock paths as ziplines, zip posts can be easily camped.Now thats out of the way I want to give more insight on the game, it has hit markers, it has bullet drop, I find the guns are balanced except for the fact that hip firing is so useless I wouldnt recommend it. The way you all spawn in the map is different than the traditional ""bus/plane"" the map is divided by what i can roughly estimate a 30x30 grid (Its a guestimate I havent actually counted) and players can choose which square they want to go, it lights up to signify its taken, so can choose to fight right off the bat or dont. The loot is not scarce at all, you will always find something somewhere, the 3 guns you can have I find is a little overkill but Im not complaining. All and all for an early access game and for me to pump out this much information in the 3 odd hours I played is just very entertaining. This is my first review of any game. Please feel free to share your thoughts, why you agree or disagree with the points i've made. P.S to the devs: Please look into the idea of making Rock climbing kits a permanent thing, it is so useful and I find it should be essential, but so far love the game, can't wait to see whats in store and potential console port. Cheers!",1
4046,"There are a number of qualities about this game that make it endearing, even to long-time players of FPS games.  It does have a very stylized look (cartoon-like), and its gameplay is not an attempt to realistically simulate combat, but because the game utilizes multiple classes, each with different abilities, Team Fortress 2 creates a diverse range of gameplay scenarios.  The acquisition of items is a rather entertaining little meta-game in itself.   Essentially, it is a shooter that can allow players on opposing teams to strategize and adapt their play as they see fit, with some players preferring Scout, Sniper, Medic, or Engineer roles (among others).  The diversity of player choices helps keep the game fresh, even long after you've played every map and scenario.  If you enjoy teamwork-shooter games, it might be worth a look.",1

It's got gliders, snowboards, and climbing pickaxes! I enjoy every moment of the game. Negative thing I have to say is that I struggle with ping because of the servers. Just hope they get EU servers or better yet ZA servers, so that we South Africans can enjoy low ping like the rest of the world.",1

8877,"Early Access ReviewRealm Royale is an enjoyabe battle royale game. I strongly recommend this game because it is fun and is unique. I say that Realm Royale has shown to be unique because it has added it's own twists to the casual battle royale genre by using the forge, class selection, horses, and by removing the parachute system. The game is new, so it will have a bug here and there, as I have come across a few bugs, but they have not seriously effected my experience playing the game. If I were to say for anything to change it would be customisation, like changing the appearance or just small combat statistic changes (even though I know that this will probably be added in soon anyway).",1
16686,"Bloons TD Battles is a decent tower defense game that seems pretty popular on mobile. It has made it way to Steam now and I have to say it is just as good here. There are a few game modes including attack game modes where you have to send waves of balloons and defend against your enemies, or the more classic defend game mode that plays like a traditional tower defense where you see who survives the longest, you or the enemy. I have not played much yet but I recommend you try it if you are looking for a free tower defense game.

I really do want this game to thrive, but I had to request a refund. I might purchase it again in a few months, but right now the game is just down right unplayable for me.",0
12569,"This game took a complete 180 since Sector 3 took over. It was a mess before, but now it's a really enjoyable simulator. Especially now that SimRacingSystem supports this game. The game is not free 2 play. It's more like a demo. You can race a few cars and tracks. But if you want to dive in a little deeper and drive GT3 (or as they call it: GTR3) cars, you have to pay. Pricing is okay for what you get. Cars are around ~4€ per car if you only choose one skin you like or like 8€ with all skins (depends on the car and how many skins are available). There are also various packs available at a discount. You can only use skins you bought. It's not possible to upload and use custom skins. But you can race against AI cars that you don't own. For a DX9 game RaceRoom looks pretty good and the performance is good, too. In the future they will make the move to the Unreal Engine, but there is no ETA when the change will happen. We will also get day/night cycles and rain with the engine change.The only complaint I have at the moment is the simulation aspect of the game. Tire temps are odd (never drop below 75°C), tire pressure is not even adjustable. After some time you will notice that RaceRoom never gets into much detail when simulating a car. The simulation aspect feels a little dumbed down compared to other sims like rFactor or Assetto Corsa. Some of the cars feel WAY too stable for 500+PS racecars from hell, while FWD cars just don't feel right and very unstable. Speaking of feeling: The FFB is one of the best of all sims. There is just so much detail, but not in an overwhelming way. If you like Racing Sims, give it a try. Also try out SimRacingSystem.",1
2127,"TL;DR at the bottom.How should I start this off..Well, this game is a free MMO Hack N' Slash type game, with a large skill tree and many builds/characters you can make to destroy your opponents with. When it says free, it truly means free. The only thing NOT free, or Micro-transaction, is the trails & certain masks as well as storage. So, in my opinion that really means it's free. Because, you aren't forced to buy anything to do certain quests, or to proceed in the game. It's a well rounded Hack n' Slash game with very unique & clean combat. The skill tree is complex, and a build guide is highly recommended for all new players. It may seem a little... Extreme the first time you open the skill tree, when I first saw it I wanted to run away and hide under a rock, but it's really nothing to be scared of. You will be met with people in the chat talking about 6L's and Unique weapons, and weapons with certain stats etc. The only real learning curve to this game is asking people what it means, or using the PoE Wiki, which for new players I would say is extremely helpful. Get this though, I don't know everything about this game.. AT ALL, I am still learning a ton of the mechanics and the functions of certain things.Pros +Free to play.+Complex & intriguing passive skill tree.+All around great game.+Extremely addicting and worth the download.+Actually FREE TO PLAY. Don't have to spend money to pass quests.+No membership.Cons-A small learning curve than will generally take about 8 - 9 hours to learn the more intermediate stuff. Some great guides on the internet about it!TL;DR Version:Great game, amazing skill tree, actually free to play! So what are you doing here?! Go play it!",1

10742,"Early Access ReviewTLDR : depth of MtG + digital smoothness of HS = muy buenoBackground : I've been playing this game in closed beta since May 2016. I had over 3000 games played until the wipe and open beta. in 2015 I was a die hard Duelyst fan, but have since completely switched over, and I don't see myself moving anytime soon.Eternal is a thinking man's CCG for the digital age, and it's the real deal. It may not necessarily be for everyone, but :- If you enjoy card game but get frustrated at HS, Duelyst, Shadowverse and consorts for their shallowness and RNG cards, this is definitely something you want to look into. - From the other end of the spectrum, if you enjoy MtG but (rightfully) hate MODO and pretty much every digital iteration of the ancestral TCG, this is absolutely for you too.Eternal is a Johnny's dream come true. The deckbuilding possibilities are endless. It's also fantastic to Spikes, I hear, what with the great balance and very low level of card RNG (yes this game has mana screw RNG, which will make you rage a lot if you come over from the HS/Duelyst/etc side, but with how low the RNG levels are through the rest of the game, skill-winrate correlation is still higher here than in any other card game I'm familiar with).Make sure to join the Discord server when you get started !

15135,"Early Access ReviewDon't let the 115 hours on record fool you. I've played this game for many hundreds of hours and enjoyed every minute of it. that is until the ""epic loot update"" which effectively removed everything fun about the game. robocraft used to allow players to save the ingame currency and work towards what they wanted. now all you can do is wish for luck in an endless grind likened best to gambling for hours with no return. this loot system is the only way to get ingame items and that being said you can never get what you want. do you have an idea for a great robot that you want to test? tough luck you'll have to hope that the Freejam Overlords look favorable upon you so you may or may not get the gear to make your bot. Don't get the wrong Idea i don't hate the game or the loot system. The problem is the ingame currency was removed meaning you cant get what you want anymore. This stunts creativity and disables one's ability to make the robots they want to. until the Epic loot system is removed and or Freejam restores the ingame currency I can not recommend this game to anyone and i will certainly not be spending my money on a company that doesn't care about its player base.Edit 1: it has come to my attention that Freejam is working to remove the Epic loot system and restore teirs as well as removing the boost system! I will change the recomendation from no to yes if and when they follow through on their promises. I may even make this my main go to game who knows?",0
13581,"Early Access ReviewI've never played Minecraft before, but when my wife picked up this game during it's free week, I decided I would check it out as well. It is absolutely FANTASTIC. I played it for about a day and a half before I decided to pay for it, and I don't even slightly regret the choice. It's still early access, and it occasionally shows, but this game shows an extremely high level of polish that i've not seen on some games that are even fully released. The bugs that i've come across are usually small, but pretty regularly re-creatable. However the depth and breadth of the game make them easy to overlook. My biggest problem is with the combat, honestly. It's almost always a battle of attrition, and if you survive, you tend to end up with low health. At that point it's almost better to just kill yourself somehow and run and get your things. Dying is basically a part of the game, so it's good that there's no REAL repercussions for doing so (other than having to go pick up the things in your bag). Some creatures are absurdly difficult, and dodging is almost a complete non-factor. You can, occasionally, find a good spot to dance a circle around a creature and not get hit, but it's inconsisitent.My 2nd largest issue is the durability of some items in the game compared to the amount of materials required to craft them. The mining cells in particular come to mind. There's one of two ways to solve this as far as I can see: Either make items with durability (like mining cells) last a lot longer, or make the odd materials to make them more readily available. I'm not saying I want my stone mining cell to last me through 18 hours of playtime, but I would like to be able to find 5 red flowers without running around for 20 minutes looking at every other tree I find.In spite of this, the game is immensely fun, and you can easily find yourself sucked into it. Digging into your mine deeper, crafting your house to look absurdly awesome, or just exploring the surprisingly vast environments, you'll find yourself readily wondering where the hours have gone. I'd definitely give this game a 9/10, because it's technically not even finished yet. You should definitely check it out.",1
6560,"I will never play this game again unless they remove the squad system. It is cancer to the game. I hate it. I used to LOVE this game.

Here I can not just switch between my tanker, fighter pilot and infantery man as i please. Fix it, or lose players.",0
13430,"4.9/5 for me but 100% AMAZING!!! MC but better! And with better building mechanics and the ability to harvest all resources with one item type, instead of one item per type of resource. Also very fun co-op play and adventure worlds. Best part, the pro version IS TOTALLY worth the $$$, just the flashlight alone would be worth it, but then on top of that you get to creat as many worlds as you like, two free property claims in any and all worlds, and the best part!!! You get the wings! :D :D OMG its so much more fun being able to fly around the world! Overall this game for me gets a 4.9/5. And the only reason it doesnt get a 5 is do to the lack of weapon types... they only have swords and throwable bombs and such ATM, no bows, staves, battle axes, or wands ETC. so again 4.9/5 I hope they add more weapon types soon!! As well I very much hope this helps you to make your decision to get the game!!! Cause you should! :D Its a fun adventure!",1

5714,"This game is a real time sink! In a positive way! I had around 70 hours of play here, before I switched to the developers version and added another few hundreds. Why did I switch installs? This is to be discussed at another place. But if you're into sims, you must try out this game. Both of the free planes are great. The SU-25T is a simplified simulation with keyboard shortcuts in place of clickable switches. But even then there is a lot to learn to master it, a lot of fun to be had with it and in the end, it is a hell of a powerful CAS aircraft. No pay to win, even on multiplayer, in this game (alas it is a pay-to-even-more-fun). Be aware that right now a lot of missions, especially training, are somewhat broken. So if something seems not quite right, go to the developers forum or even better, build your own missions in the mission editor to try stuff out. TF-51D is an unarmed P-51 variant with a beautiful flight model and clickable controls. Great for trying out some aerobatics or flying practice in general. So there is enough to do to fill month before you even have to spend the first cent...but once you get the first high fidelity models or just FC3, this thing can become a full time occupation.

The gameplay is fine, the graphics is fine, the audio is fine, there's a few bugs and sometimes there's lag that sometimes cause you to lose and this is partly what cause the one problem. Salt.One thing every competitive game have in common, but this game has more salt than you anticipate on a 2D Super Smash Bros-like game. Almost everytime you join a game whether you lose or win, you will get trash talked almost every one of them and it gets annoying at times especially when you're in a bad mood and thus possibly break something due to rage. If you just want to play it to troll the hell out of people to break some nerves into them then sure yeah, but if you don't want any salt thrown at you then don't play this game. It pisses me off sometimes due to the people trash talking at me and I wouldn't recommend this game if you're sensitive.

I was instead pleasently surprised to find a fairly fleshed out combat system and a fun take on the BR genre.PROS:-Fun combat-Classes-Fun and useful class specific abilities-Fresh take on armor and weapon upgrades (using forges)-Mounts for Movement speed-Last but not least, YOU TURN INTO A CHICKEN WHEN YOU GO DOWN. Perhaps the games most interesting way that it sets itself apart from other BR's is that instead of dying flat out, even in a solo game you turn into a chicken when your health reaches 0 and you get to hop around dipping and dodging while your opponent tries to end youre chicken life. Now for the ConsCONS:-Uninspired locations on maps-Bland art style-Controls are sometimes clunky-The loot system is hot garbage. As the game stands as I write this, you can open 9 chests in a row and get armor and abilities instead of a weapon. It can be fairly infuriating.This game is in Alpha and if the devs continue to improve this game, it will find a fair amount of success. 9/10 For a FREE Alpha",1

9592,"a fairly addictive 2d bullet hell game.be prepared to grind a lot, but the grinding is far from boring. dungeons are randomly generated, and can also have treasure rooms to multiply your loot gain.by far my favorite part of the game is the loot system. the more damage you do to the boss, the more loot you get. it inscentivises and rewards actively tackling the boss instead of leeching, though some more difficult bosses drop treasure chests that contain the loot.the game currently still has a lot of problems, left by the old developers.kabam's logic ""instead of fixing duping, let's just make a lot of the rarest items in the game untradable.""""we'll ban some people for hacking if they're reported, but not have moderators to actively survey the situation.""""let's make some of the BEST ITEMS IN THE GAME AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE IN THE STARTING AREA FOR TEN DOLLARS SO THAT NEW PLAYERS CAN SEE HOW GREAT WE ARE""all in all, 10/10 praise deca",1
6698,I've played this game for a long time. This game has slowly become grindier and grindier. The devs were good of thought but they became greedy with prices. You used to get a base rifle and gernades with all three class and unlock the smg and bazookas fairly early on and now you start with one faction and only the base rifle.In short was good and become too grindy. They keep taking things away from players and raise level requirements over time.,0

It only has 2 crews and six ships at the moment, but enough veriety in them that no match is the same and that every battle is enuiqe. now for a new game (and keep in mind it is a early access game and will be for a while) there isnt to many players, and it is a little buggy. some matches lag and freeze then all of a sudden your in the main menue again But the devs are fixing it every day and are lisstening to us the playes to make this game batter. but aside from that i highly recomend this game to people who love space battles, the sounds, the styles, the combat, the ships, the easy to learn controls, to the custom loadout ships. Its simply a good fun game.",1

5239,"This game has the potential to be so good. But the community is freaking terrible, and honestly this game has made me angrier than any other game that I've ever played. I can't say that I recommend it. If you are someone that doesn't get angry at games typically, this game will bring out the worst in you. I say this because in the lower ranks, 99% of the players you will play against are sig spammers and smurfs. There are no words to describe how angry this game has made me, you would need to play it yourself to understand. I give it a 6/10. The game itself is great, and the developers are constantly releasing updates which is super nice, but the community is just so unbelievably garbage that I can't put it any higher than that.",0
6699,"PAY TO WIN [written @ 33 ingame hours]Changed from negative to positive because I REALLY like this game. It really reminds me of the good old Wolfenstein ET days. A WWII shooter that doesn't take itself to seriously. Sadly this game is pay2win but it's not horrific. You can earn ALMOST everything with just playing but you will need to sink in hundreds of hours and you WILL lose lots of 1v1's just because the other dude has a better gun in the meantime. What makes a gun better? More damage and more bullets in the magazine for me but that depends on who you ask. At around 50 hours of play I can unlock the same so than we're even with that. But theres tanks, planes etc. You will be a huge disadvantage for a long long time. Plus you can't buy the 2nd passive without spending IRL money. But it also comes with some positives.Over time your weapons will get damaged and you'll need to repair them. It's not super expensive, but grenades are VERY expensive. If you spam them you can easily make a negative income. IMO this is a good thing, less nade spam like in COD and Battlefield.Overal it feels a lot like Wolfestein ET to me, which for me is good. There's a only a handful of small maps sadly, but they are made very well. I wish they had a SDK like WOLFET had, so people could make more maps, that's really what this game needs imo, more small maps. It got a lot of big maps for tanks and stuff, but ultimately that's a huge battle of which team has the most 1000 hour players and or payers (pay 2 win) and are therefore less fun to me. Now you can have fun being free2play but a lot less. This game kinda requires you to have a subscription running in order to make a little money.I hope they go for a new business model with this or a new game because this model really upset most people. The only reason I stick is because it reminds me a lot of WOLFET my favorite shooter like ever. It's not the same, but it gives me the same dopamine rush so it works for me. I really wish they made it less grindy and find another way to monitize so it doesn't put people off.Also this game is NOT full with sweaty try hards so casual players got a decent chance at this imo. As a casual myself. Of course sometimes there are a few sweaty try hards who annihilate you, but that's it.",1
1862,"I dont get this game, it's like Civilization, every one picks one of the 108 country but it's a 5v5 game. The diplomatic exchanges with your team mates are limited because you can trade a limited amount of luxuries and you have to spend a big amount of gold to upgrade your country, there is no research feature, also the spying are realy limited as you can only place ""wards"" (wich replace spys in this game) on the map but they are usless. They are city states but they just stand here and hit what's in range and never come to help you when you are far from them. Finaly there a only 3 era (early, mid and late) but it dont change much the gameplay and some country are too OP in the late era and you can't buy atomic bomb to nuke them2/10, this game lacks a lot of content to pretend to be a Civlization-Like",0
8310,"First off I need to say I am a huge Dungeons and Dragons fan. I have been since Baldur's gate and the original SSI Goldbox PC games. So, I jumped at the chance to play an MMO of my favorite setting and world. I have not been disappointed at all. If you are hardcore into Faerun lore and enjoy a good D&D themed setting and action MMO combat, then this is the place for you.I've been playing this game nonstop since early June of this year (review written at the end of August). Module 4 has just been released and I am enjoying it a lot. A lot of people say this game is ""pay to win"" and I simply have to say that this is not true. yes, you can buy all the best gear from the in game auction house because most gear is ""bind on use"" instead of ""bind on pickup,"" so if you don't have use for a drop that you win you can sell it on the AH. This, being a free to play game, does have a cash shop, but except for some companions and the more expensive packs (dragonborn pack and hero of the north pack) you cannot buy ""power."" Everything is either cosmetic or utility.One thing I will say is that this game is very solo friendly. Even if you put real money into buying things in this game it is still a grind heavy game. You'll be grinding for weeks (and in some cases months) to get what you want. I personally really enjoy it as it gives me something to always do. The grinds feel involving and fun to me. Each of the different campaigns offers you ways to permanently increase the power of your character over time. The daily areas also have solo dungeons that end in an epic boss fight, so each time you do them it still feels pretty epic, even if you already know what to expect.Leveling in Neverwinter feels more like a typical MMO setup than D&D, but the D&D flavor is still there in everything. The stories are involved and there are several solo dungeons that you'll do in each zone as you're leveling up. These provide an epic single player experience and some of them can be quite challenging (Rime Fang, I'm looking at you). The zones in Neverwinter are somewhat gated and not open world in the slightest. If you've ever played Neverwinter Nights 2 for PC they feel a lot like that. Leveling speed is relatively fast. I was able to reach max level (60) on my first character within 3 weeks. This is an MMO that I will be playing for a very long time. End game group content is a lot of fun and quite challenging. The largest group you'll ever need for anything is 5 people as raiding has not been added to this game yet. However I do have to say one thing bad about this game. DO NOT USE THE IN GAME GROUPFINDER OR LFR CHANNEL TO FIND END GAME GROUPS! The game is unfortunately full of exploiters and gear score elitists that are very very unfriendly towards new players. BUT, there is something you can do! Join the channel /NW_legit_community and form your end game groups in that channel. Sure it might take a while to form a group, but you'll be with the best Neverwinter has to offer. This channel welcomes new players and helps them learn. This channel doesn't care about your gearscore. As long as its high enough to queue for the dungeon that is good enough to get a group in this channel. Its basically the only place outside of my guild that I will form dungeon delves with. The community is entirely player moderated and has been very successful for me. I was lucky that I found that channel shortly after I started playing.My name is Sharastrix@zshikara in game. Please feel free to ask me any questions you may have.",1

Due to the nonresponsive keyboard, I wasn't even able to exit the game.  I eventually managed to force quit the game with some fancy mousing, and discovered that DCS had actually disabled my keyboard completely, which would explain why even Ctrl-Alt-Del wouldn't work.From the reviews I've seen I'm sure DCS World is playable and possibly even enjoyable, but it certainly didn't give me the opportunity to experience that first-hand.",0

2602,"I want to love this game, I really do. Tank sims are my jam, and this one is a lot of fun from that perspective.However, it is extremely unbalanced in favor of the Allies, particularly from battle-rating 4.7 to about 7.0 (a very significant proportion of the German tree). Mid-war German tanks will frequently be facing late and even post-war vehicles from the Allies, thus negating any of the perks that German tanks historically had. Matches are often frustrating because you will be facing enemies that you can't possibly hope to defeat given the limitations of the game itself and the fact that most players are utterly clueless about teamwork (though that doesn't come as a surprise in today's online gaming environment).Another huge problem is spawn camping. There's basically nothing that stops players from sitting near their enemy's respawn area and shooting people as soon as they spawn in.Hopefully Gaijin will seek to balance the game more in the future, but somehow I doubt it. I recommend this game if you enjoy tank/flight simulators in the World War 2/Early Cold War era, but prepare to be extremely frustrated by the Battle-Rating system and spawncamping.",0
1470,"Early Access ReviewUpdate:  1 Year and 125 hours of gameplay later and this game has risen to my all time favorites list.  Matchmaking now takes significantly less time to find a round thanks to a slowly but noticably expanding player base.  New and awesome ships are being added on a very regular basis by the devs (every month or so).  Visuals are even more beautiful and powerful than before.  A lot of recent reviews are ripping on the new crew drop system, but it's really not that bad.  It's just heavily focused on grinding.  But the devs are active and listening, so I would not be surprised if we see suble tweaks to this system in the coming months.  I would like to also comment on a complaint I've heard a lot:  No, this game is NOT pay-to-win!  Lots of people are complaining that the 'platinum' currency is pay-to-win, but all it's used for is exclusive ship skins that ONLY change aesthetics.  Now that this game has entered free-to-play, you can pick it up and eventually own every ship and weapon available without spending a dime -- though you, myself, and most others, have a significant grind to look forward to before such a goal can be achieved.  Challenge accepted!  Now go play Fractured Space!- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Original review below:Only had the chance to play one round so far but from what I can tell I'm really going to like this game.  There is definitely an initial learning curve, since I didn't get a single kill in that round...and my team lost...terribly, but that was the most fun I've ever had losing!  The ship textures are beautiful!  The weapons are tacticle, diverse, and just awesome!  I'd definitely recommend watching some youtube tutorials before jumping straight into a game, otherwise you might be a bit lost, as there is no starting tutorial at this time (though devs say they're working on it).  My only complaint is some pretty severe, albeit intermittent, lag spikes.  I have a network meter on my 2nd monitor and when my ship would freeze, I'd see the network connection tank.  Would last about 5-10 seconds, then when it regained connection my ship would snap across the map to where it had aparently been going.  Died a couple times because of that.  (Not a problem with my network btw.  It handles all other online games including BF4 flawlessly).  I'm hoping that sorts itself out through development (or that I was just playing on a bad server).  All in all, this is a REALLY fun game.  The sort of game I've been looking for for a long time.  It's like battleships meets league of legends meets starwars.  I'm really excited to see how this game progresses as the devs work on it.  I would definitely recommend it!",1

7007,"By the egg, a fine battle.- For reasons unknown, I am enjoying this far more than I ever did Hearthstone. Perhaps it's the refined, mature art style; perfect for a gentleman like me. Perhaps it's the class system and abundance of cards, providing just the right amount of freedom and choice whilst not feeling overwhelming.The business model seems, fair, as well. Get ready for the face-smashing grind against AI if you want to accrue crafting gems as a free-to-player.

Airplanes are terrible to control properly and the physics of the game driving cars and tanks around is just terrible. Some of the weapons they add to the game makes no sense. The Russians are given a rifle that can pick out light armour tanks like nothing.The UI has become even worse then what it was before. There is now layer uppon layer with chat windows, Squad information and all other kinds of nonsense making you feel lost if you where new to the game.

14402,"Early Access ReviewAlright, as you can see I have spent almost 900 hours on this game so I am obviously not new to this but at the current state that this game is in, I would not recommend this game to anyone. I first played when the game was new (i.e. when T2, T4, T6, T8, T10 weapons were called S-Types) on a friends account. This game was perfect for me, fun and engaging gameplay and you needed proper tactics to win. Then we got aerofoils and this was a very important part to this game since before the only type of flying robots were helium drones and you copuld not place plasmas on the bottom so you had to make it so you could flip it around to make a plasma bomber. My favourite period for RC was durong the Walker and Nano update. Nanos were the most important class for a team and often decided the winning team and walkers were very interesting to play with and meant you could explore the entire map and made rails a very interesting opponent. Also, there were still tech points!The last time that RC was enjoyable for me was the ROBOCRAFT Unleashed update. This is the battle arena update which although I thoroughly enjoyed, it made it impossible to get into a TDM game and made Megas redundantAfter this, they removed tiers and tiered blocks, megabots, gc and rp. They added so many new weapons in a short period of time, changed the currency, ruined the economy and made end-game players the exact same as newbies.Also, since GC is gone, all GC only components are now available to everyone. This is bad for me as I had bought EVERY mask, 6x Carbon SMGs, 6x Carbon MSMGs, 2x USA flags, 2x UK flags, 2x Vapour trails (The big ones), 4x Vapour trails (Smaller ones), 4x Speedometers, 2x Altimeters, 10x Vampire Bat wings & rudders (10 of each) and 10x Bat wings & rudders (10 of each). I also had 6 months of premium. What a waste of money this game is. So, in conclusion, this game is a waste of time and a money grab. Thanks FJ for ruining a once amazing and popular game!",0

I've honestly lost count on how many matches i had with my 6.7 BR tanks where i have had the unfortunate ""match-making"" out me in with Leopards, M47s, Maus' and the odd T54 and M60 here and there.

1634,"This is a MOBA game, what else could I say about it?I'm pretty sure you've read a bunch of reviews upon dota before coming to this review. Getting straight to the point that this game is probably worth playing if you're interested in facing individuals across the internet, with the probability of being skilled in tactics and strategy. These strategies and tactics are accomplished via the vast cast of characters within dota, each with their own set of abilities, roles (most characters are not confined to their specificed roles), and given a wide variety of items that can produce a devastating or riduculous combination that will cripple the enemy team.If you're up to play this game, let it be discerned that how you interact with your teammates is vital in your aim to win the match against the opposing team. An example of what I mean would be communication: within this game, you will not always be paired with individuals that you will be on equal footing with, however you and the other persons that comprise your team will have to compromise to make of what you can to achieve the same goal: TO WIN. In addition, aside how you communicate with another, you could gain ideas of how to play a certain character, plot ingenius tactics, and enjoy the sensation of teamwork resulting from communication.Leaving off on one final note: Remember that every loss within dota, show be a gain via reflection. See what has been done wrong or hasn't been done at all with your comrades, and together offer strategies and suggestions for future matches. Do not let the loss of a match get to your head; always remain composed, and level headed.",1

Although I have only played the defense mode part I pretty much know how everything in all the other modes go so it is so sad.Pro/s:- Cute monkeysCons:- Not a new user friendly game, the tutorial is outdated and only covers the send your enemies with balloon thingies- I crashed and froze countless times in the middle of a match for some weird reason.

9244,"Full disclaimer, I am not an FPS kind of guy. I don't have the twitch reflexes nor the situational awareness to do well in shooters. I usually get killed in the middle of trying to get a bead on the person who just head-shotted me. Having said all of that, and not having spent that much time with this game, I can confidently say that this is a good one. The visuals are pleasing and the interface is intuitive. To a noob like me, things can be a little overwhelming at first, but if you are fortunate enough to have a buddy who is a regular player to show you the ropes, it will greatly ease your introduction into the vast battleground in the game world. I like the use of vehicles as well as the character classes, though it does put me off that you can come back as a different class every time you die and respawn. I prefer a certain amount of investment and commitment in the class or role that I play. There is defintely fun to be had here, especially if you play as a part of a team of friends that you are used to playing with. And hey, it's free to play. If I was better at FPS, I'd definitely play this game regularly.",1

The saying ""easy to learn, hard to master"" totally applies here and ranked mode can really get the best of you (if my broken mouse is reading this, i didnt mean to throw you against the wall).

15973,"Early Access ReviewOnly played about 4.5 hours, and so far I've been enjoying it. No I've not really played the 2D version of the game but I don't think it matters.For a game that's only 54MB in file size I think it's worth to download and try it. Obviously this means that you shouldn't be expecting super high end graphics but I still somewhat like the Artstyle. The game is kinda grindy as with most MMORPGs, but that's to be expected. The questing system also ties with the crafting system in game, where materials dropped by monsters in a certain zone will usually also have an NPC who'll craft gear for you with said dropped materials alongside giving you quests. Crafting items usually will take you between 15-40 Mins, which is reasonable in my opinion for now but I'm guessing it'll increase as you craft higher levelled items. Currently the max level is 15, but don't let that number fool you, as I've only managed to hit level 6 4 hours into the game.I'm not sure if it's intended but you're free to change between the various classes whenever you want at any level and for the most part gears can be used across all classes. I started off as a Warrior, but since changed to a Mage who hits way harder. Overall a decent game.",1

Steam loves to mess up with other games that use theyr own launcher, do not trust Steam.Game is great, still feels unfinished, but certainly is more alive than H1D1 (2 years old) that daybreak is constantly trying to keep alive, meanwhile planetside 2 (much much older) is doing just great, but needs more attention from Daybreak to get better.Planetside 2 is not like CS:GO or other FPS where you have matchmaking, in here you fight in a war, and wars dont separate the newbies from veterans, play with the best and become the best.TIP TO GET BETTER -> either shot in the head, or shot in the body if you can't have a clear headshot, there's no science to the game. Veterans simply know when and where to hit you (map reading is very important too, you'll get the hang of it eventualy).I totaly recomend this game even if it feels unfinished, you can have some pretty epic moments once in a while.It is also better played with ""Recursion Stat Tracker"", search it up, its easy to install and use.",1

1580,"I originaly enjoyed the game in alpha... beta.. due to there actually being teamwork. Though, at the time, there were not many players it was fun, tactical, strategic. As time has moved on, and FS have grown with updates, improvements, ships etc... it is a good game BUT only for occasional play. In my view.We cannot force players to teamwork, and unless a game mechanic is invented, never will. As FS has grown the teamwork has decreased proportionaly to it...seriously so much that it is 1/5 Teamwork games (this is out of about 50 games played to work this out). Sadly it has almost become a total solo play experience.Kudos to the developers, who i feel are really trying to give FS a future, but the game population seems to be falling. It can take on average 8 - 15 minutes for a PVP game queue ( again out of 50 games). The quick play idea is great if you just want to dive right in to the action for AI games though not so great if you want PVP.The maps are a good size and tactical. Ships well designed and are continously being updated.",0
16501,"Needs some improvements to really be a high rated game. Whats good: Taking apart and reassembling.  Its not perfect. The controls are really wonky, and instructions aren't totally clear.  It's not always completely flexible either.  But still. this part of the game is a lot of fun. And, as a gun owner, it was fun to take apart the same gun I own in a game, and see its interpretation of such. What needs improvement: The shooting range. It's god awful.  They could really borrow from ARMA 3 or AA for some more realisic shooting.  This feels like a cheesy arcade shooter, and the recoil and ballistics are way off. I realize that maybe its not to be taken seriously, but this game is going to invite gun nuts like myself to play. and when we go to the range portion.. its going to let us down. I have to reaffirm these points because the game also presumes to reach for your wallet at every turn. Want that next gun? Buy it with real money, or grind exp for eternity. want that other range? Yep. pay up.. or grind. its okay to ding around in with the free version for a bit, but otherwise... its not worth a long time play.

13351,"I've played 44 hours so far, so I think I can make a review about it. The game is very similar with Minecraft, so most of the stuff from there would be here aswel.Here are some pros and cons.PROS:-The game is free to play.-It's so simple to make the server and to have others join. You can make it private (just for you and friends) or you can make it public and have a lot of ppl join in.-The game have nice features to protect yourself from trolls and noobs. -Good graphics! -You can rotate every block in the game (even furniture), so you can build cool structures and have good decorations.-The game is harder than minecraft, it has a nicer combat imo.-It takes much longer to build and craft stuff wich i find it more compeling-You have a sense of progression. You unlock recipes by descovering blocks and crafting stuff.-The game lets you build your own adventure and share it with the community. (not something that i find fascinating, but its a nice feature)-You can customize your character.CONS:-The game has some bugs. The ladder is so annoying, you won't fit on it properly, you have to struggle, it feels like the character is to big to fit into a 1 block gap with the ladder. Sometimes when you close doors or traps, you get pushed into the air and fall to death. You can farm some resources with ease (diamonds and coals), by using glitches. Sometimes when you use a potion or food to regen, it won't activate. (Those bugs are rare, not something that will annoy you, beside the ladder, that is so annoying, but they need to be fixed).-The game doesn't have weather (rain, snow, thunderstorms.... ect.), instead it has a temperture that it shows up whenever you are in a specific zone (savannah is really hot and you can burn to death or in the mountains you can freeze to death if you don't have a fire nearby). The temperature is a really nice feature, but combined with weather or seasons, that would have been so much better and insane!!! -The tree leaves won't decay. They just stay in the air after you take a tree down.-FPS problems in the multiplayer. Rare small rollbacks (not something that will be a problem). Need to be better optimised. Not a big problem, not something that will occur everytime.-The game need to have more monster models, more adventures. Portals to other worlds. Bosses need to be added. More content would really make the game better.-The game does not have a hunger feature in it. You can't starve. You can craft food however and use it to regen your health.-Wanted to see some zombies in it. Wanted to see some random villages with npcs that can sell stuff like it minecraft. Adding humanoids would have been nice.-Wanted to see more blocks and decorations.My conclusion:The game is really nice to play with friends and to have that minecraft vibe in a f2p game. The game have nice graphics and new mechanics and ideas that you can't see in Minecraft, but it also lacks several cool features from Minecraft. The game could really become incredible if more content were to be added into the game. Beside the issues that it has and the lack of some features, it's stil a very good game, one that I enjoyed so far and will play it more. I recommend it! I also hope the game will be active and the devs will improve it over the next months and years.",1

Even though it is a bit dated now, the graphics still are great in my opinion and the game can run on pretty much any basic game machine.

If your're sitting at home bored, get this game, call up your friends and make a squadron.

5118,Early Access ReviewThis game brings back so many memories from when I was a kid playing Super Smash Bros. The combat and just overall look and feel of the game is so nostalgic. The fighter roster is a good size right now and the various stages you can battle on add some interesting challenges when in the heat of battle. This game is an amazing experience and I think everyone should give it a try.,1
6290,"I have played this game since early BETA. Several years, I took a 6 month break and came back to check out the new map changes.After three days I deleted the game. The community has become toxic. I could not take the endless♥♥♥♥♥♥talk, racism and misogynist comments from our own team. Harrassment of new players was outrageous.It used to be every few battles there was one or two. You could ignore them or reasonable players would coach them. That has ended and I would no longer endorse this game or suggest it to anyone.Sad really.",0

A great game with friends no skill required because theres no balance in that game, and that what makes it so fun!In a winning position?

13714,"Early Access ReviewMuch better than Minecraft, for creative discovery, for the following reasons.  Crafting guides you towards what you need (no more having to look it up elsewhere online), and requires more appropriate resources (you cut a wood block into multiple slabs or rods instead of building a stick out of multiple wood blocks, and two sticks for a handle).  The scenery is generated with impressive variety, trees of various kinds with branches, vines, flowers, etc.  There are different terrains to find various items that change the scenery quite a bit.  Mining is more logical with depth being important for what you're looking for.  Creative play is easier to setup without bouncing between ""survival"" and ""god-mode creative"" modes, it's a good balance where you have to work, but not struggle.  Maps are shared online, so I don't have to be online to share a world with my son.  Not paying $27 times two is a big bonus as well, and blueprints are fairly enjoyable to work together on similar to a co-op resource gathering 3D puzzle board.I recommend this for anybody who wants to get into Minecraft creative exploration style play with their friends or family, but doesn't want to put up with all the difficulty of setup, wants to save some money, or just wants more options and a more enjoyable time.  It is plenty fun with the Free version, I'll likely upgrade to the Pro once my son masters the game a bit more.",1
5094,"Early Access ReviewGreat game, But needs a TON more work done on it before it's a title worth spending any money on. (Though the devs look like they will be delivering that ton more content it needs.)      For those complaining about the online being hard it's because people playing this game on the PC are not used to brawlers or the strategy involved in them.(Not many brawler type games for the PC, even fewer have online gameplay.)      One good tip is when one guy has 9 points and the rest of the team is averaging around 2 then they need to work together to get the points balanced again.      Otherwise the guy with 9 point just has to get hit once by the lowest scorer and ""accidentally"" fall off the map whenever his damage is high to keep anyone else from getting anywhere near him score wise. (Easy win for anyone who actually read this.) There are many other tips and tricks assosiated with games exactly like this. But I'm too lazy to list em all.       Just use your heads people. (Something that pc gamers have been doing allot less of since game capable computers have become easily affordable for the generall public. Lets not end up like console online gaming.)     I wrote this review in hopes that I can inspire better tactics in the player base.... it's way to easy to win at the moment and it makes the game dull.     Review cap  Highest scorer= Biggest threat.                       and Feeding the weakest player when damage is high= Easy wins.",1
8408,"     While Neverwinter leaves a bad taste in some folks mouths, I found it be fun, fast, and creative.  Sure, every free-to-play game has to chase the paper a bit,  but the only things that aren't available to the average player are upgrades that make the playtime faster.  And honestly, you might be cheating yourself if you try to shorten the amount of time you put in for stuff.  For me, Neverwinter is about following traditional DND ideals in a new way, with a cohesive vision and storyline.  There isn't a large free-roam world, but I find it refreshing to actually know where to go and what to do.  There's plenty of surprises and secrets, there's plenty of tough battles, and there's a lot to do.  When you max out your levels you've only really played about half the game as it is.  The foundry (playermade quests) adds an ever expanding option as well, so it's tough to get bored with Neverwinter.       If you're in to competitive multiplayer however, that's where Neverwinter falls short.  The PVP is fun and fast paced, but at the higher levels there's a noticable advantage between folks that invest money and those who don't.  As stated before, you can get almost everything in the game through playing, but the amount of time you have to put in as opposed to the few dollars you can spend leaves you a bit discouraged.  The money system in the game is pretty weird too, as you have Zen coins, Astral Diamonds, and Gold/Silver/Copper.  The gold you get from killing monsters is nearly worthless as you progress, and most in-game trading is done through the Astral Diamonds.      I think that this game is an overall success, and If you're on the fence, I'd say go ahead and play it- It's free.  You level rather quickly anyway, so you can get the gist of classes and playstyle without delay.  Happy Adventuring!",1

1208,"Early Access ReviewAbsolutely ingenious, amazingly fun and overwhelmingly addictive game. The gameplay is well balanced, the graphics are gorgeous (Unreal Engine 4) and the sound design is mindblowing - imagine a huge Destroyer ship jumping into the vicinity and opening up its broadside bombardment on enemies to save you from certain death - the feeling is undescribable.Premium elements do not in any way give paying players an unfair advantage, as their effect is strictly cosmetic or time-saving (getting more XP and/or credits so you can get your desired ship(s) faster).I got the game for free to keep during the free weekend in January, 2016, but its overall quality convinced me to buy the the top tier (Vanguard) Founders Pack very, very fast. The only problems I have come across so far were related to matchmaking, but usually went away quickly. I would also welcome an addition of bigger lobbies in the game (you are currently only able to invite one friend to join you in an epic space battle).    Bottom line, Fractured Space is the first game in ages which I am seriously hooked on.",1
1836,"Dota 2 is a 5-v-5 MOBA game. You have a selection out of 108 unique heroes, each with a unique skillset. Every hero is also available from the minute you start. No playing X amount of games before this hero becomes available.The object of Dota 2 is to destroy the other teams’ Ancient. To do this, you can work your way down any of the 3 lanes (Top, Mid or Bottom) by destroying the outer towers. You’ll start most matches pairing up or going into a lane solo trying to get some experience and gold by last hitting creeps. As the game progresses, you’ll start teaming up more with your other team members to take on the other team or to quickly kill of a solo member of their team.Because of the importance of coordinating your attacks with other team members, communication is a very important aspect of the game. I therefor also recommend playing this game with some friends because random people that you’ll be teamed up with won’t always show the same willingness to communicate. If you’re just starting out playing Dota 2, I also recommend playing with a friend who already has some experience in the game because the learning curve is very steep, especially when you have to figure everything out by yourself. The skill ceiling is also extremely high. So every time you play, you might learn something new. Due to the high number of available heroes, skills and items, you can be sure that every game is unique.Something to be wary of is the community. There are people out there that take this game way more seriously than you might. Most players have an opinion of what you should have done in a certain situation and will be happy to blame a lost teamfight on you not taking that action. Flaming is something that could happen often. But if you’re playing with a team entirely made up of your friends, this shouldn’t prove to be an issue. If this is not the case, don’t worry. You can always mute the players that are causing you grief and continue enjoying this wonderful, team oriented game.",1

10986,"Early Access ReviewI wanted to find a secondary card game next to Shadowverse for causal play. I had a lot of people recommend Eternal to me, so I gave it a try... and I'm honestly done with this after only about 2.5 hours. Now, as far as I understand the game is very similar to MtG in terms of mechanics. I never played MtG. Thanks to that I felt like a fish out of water right from the get go. The initial story mode serves as a tutorial. A very bad one. It tells you what to do, but rarely why and only go through mechanics that are baltantly obvious. I thought that I got an okay grasp on the game, so I jumped into the puzzle section, because people told me that mode is essentialy an advanced tutorial.I couldn't even finish the basic ones. I got increasingly frustrated, so I ended up looking up guides. And on like every second puzzle, I was like ""WAIT, you can do that?! Why the hell didn't the game bothered to tell me that?!"". Here's the thing: Eternal has possibly the worst tutorial I've ever seen. The idea of a tutorial is that first it explains the player what's what, then tests said player on what was just explained. Eternal skips the explaining part entirely and just throws the tests in front of you. You want to learn to swim? In the shark tank you go!By the time I finished the puzzles, I had enough of the game. I felt utterly lost, confused and lost all confidence in myself regarding the mechanics. So I went online and found a guide on the mechanics of the game. A 75 pages long PDF that is. And that was the point where just uninstalled this. If your game is so complicated that it needs an entire damn book to explain its mechanics, then have the decency to have a damn tutorial that isn't hot garbage!If you are an MtG veteran, you will probably like this. If you are looking for an alternative to Hearthstone, Shadowverse, etc. then keep looking.",0

Great game, solid tutorial which sets you up for success for first timers.

What i liked about the agme is that because you could change mounts, classes adn weapons for game play change. and you could also, explore a whole new world. desert, sky island, lava land, snow biome. the game is fun for me now but like a friend said (brunkebop) the game is bearly playable for begginers.the first 5 mins for them is fun but afterwards you repeat, and repeat, and repeat. unless you're not a free to play player.",0

The ""Point Defence System"" is great for intercepting enemy missiles, and never forget to use it when you encounter an enemy, because it could mean life and death.Leveling up from 1 to 3 is pretty quick too, once you hit level 3 you can start playing co-op and pvp. Haven't really tried all the features yet, but it's a decent game for anyone who wants to feel a fresh space fighting thing-a-ma-jig.. Sad thing is, it's a bit long to find players for PVP, dunno if it was me who played at a wrong time, or because not many people have installed the game yet..

4860,"At this point in time i have 799 hours logged. I'm gonna do a short and sweet review of the game and try and list a few things that are diffrent than other MOBA'S and hopefully give you guys some insight for people looking to get into the game. Smite is a 3rd person MOBA unlike most MOBA's, which are usually top down, now with that being said makes the game imo a whole diffrent type of MOBA and the way i prefer to play a MOBA.I've only played around 3 matches of LoL, and as ive said before i prefer the 3rd person aspect, top down games just arent my style, so i cant really compare this to other MOBA'sNow. to get to the basics, you have your Guardians,Mages,Warriors,Hunters and Assassins, All of which are all fun to play my preffered class would usually be a guardian or mage seeing that not many people choose to play guardians and that hunters are far to generic.Hunters- Hunters are your standard point and hold left click for the most part they are effective early game but most useful in late game scenarios to shut down the lower health gods easily and also beat down your enamy Tank.Mages- All around good class used to shut down most all god types most having a very diffrent kit and reasonably diffrent from each other enough to realize you're playing another god and not a re-skin of another.Guardians- Guardians are your preferred tank class although warriors can also be very tanky most guardians are fun in their own way and all have a play in the game but less than the other classes imo unless the right hands are behind them.Warriors- Warriors are very fun to play alot of them have good kits and some of them being very overpowered in the right hands and some being huge game changers for your 5v5 fights in late game joust.Assassins- Assassins are very crucial to your Conquest matches (5v5) and quite a few of them are left untouched during seasons due to a few being Overpowered, They're used for your jungling and to gank lane as most moba's.Now that thats over with i'd like to touch base on a few of the things i like and dont like about smite.Pro's- Visually the game looks great every one of the gods are very detailed, maps look great and the spells and abilities really bring all of it to life during matches.3rd person aspect- as ive said before i dont enjoy top down games and if you do thats fine you may still like smite regardless, Top down just isnt my cup of tea.Community- All in all the community is great in a whole if you join in solo for the most part if there are people playing solo as well they are usually nice, although you can have teams of clan people who are toxic just as there would be toxic people in other Moba's but smite seems to have less toxicity than other Moba's too me.Updates-Smite is regularly updated with new content Very Often, in the last year It's seen around 11 new gods meaning we see new gods almost every month, Gods usually stay relatively balanced with your select few that are more overpowered than others, but High-Rez stays on top of it.Gods-All of the gods feel diffrent to me very few of them have simialar skills and for the most part all of the gods in the game are fun and ANY of them can be good if they are in the right hands.Cons-Unfortunately there are some bad things about smite and i will tell you what my biggest problems with the game are.Hunters- Hunters are fun to play and i wont lie i love to play Neith,Ah Muzen Cab, Xblanque and many others, BUT they need to be nerfed unlike League (going by word of mouth) Yes, their abilities help them in fights tremendously but some if not all of them by end game only have to hold down left click to kill anybody, doesnt matter what their opponent is even guardians get melted with full physical protection, I'd suggest removing penetration items from the game, They make being a guardian not fun.Guardians- There are alot of fun guardians in the game BUT, as ive said in the previous statement Hunters can melt them, just as any other class can in the right hands, they just dont feel tanky enough most of the time no matter how much armor you build, and even at this point you can build for damage so you do no damage and die regardless due to the lack of damage resistance from said armor. Although there are many guardians that do alot of damage and are seemingly tankier than others leaving the other guardians hanging out to dry.Now that ive gotten my two biggest gripes over classes out of the way ill list a few diffrent other urks i have with the game.I've previously stated that there isnt alot of toxicity in the game but, I like to play assault alot and i've done this before just in case someone reading this recognizes my name, Being toxic or talking crap in this game-mode makes you look like a huge dbag, You're not playing Ranked-Conquest. Stop acting like it, Thats my only problem with the community is that i can understand when someone is purposely throwing the match/feeding but, if you watch and see that they're actually trying, give them a chance if you lose at the end of the match say gg, nice try they may be new and your actions could be the reason that they stop playing the game, meaning we're losing people from an amazing game that already has a much smaller player base than the likes of Dota 2, or LoL.Last thing is the server downtime, I want this game to grow, and i want the playerbase to grow also, But, it seems like and moreso here recently that the servers have been down quite a bit. in The last month there was upwards of a week (altogether) that i couldnt play because of server downtime. I've read many articles stating that it's Because of DDOS from other developers, I would hope that another company wouldnt stoop that low. My problem with all of this is not that im missing out on playing but afraid that at some point people will get tired of it and go to something else, and im sure im not the only person that feels this way. So High-Rez you've made one of my favorite games of all time, Please, try and fix this problem.Thats the end of all of my pro's/con's and gripes of the game Hopefully this will help you to decide to play or not to play and it answered some questions for you.I'll update my review if anything else sticks out to me.

7113,"Pay to win. It was good until the Skyrim update, but now there are tons of overpowered cards that should be nerfed ASAP.UPD March 2018: by now, I have also experienced problems with matchmaking. Probably, because in February I accidently reached a competitive rank milestone that I had never reached before and that is obviously above my actual level, the next month I was matched with too strong players while still having the lowest rank. It used to be that I rapidly reach a certain milestone and then it goes as victory - loss - victory - loss, i.e. in the way it should be. But then there was an endless losing streak before I could make any progress - very unpleasant. It has become better by the end of the month, though.Meanwhile, overpowered decks remain. The worst thing is werewolfs. There are many decks that can nuke your opponent very fast, but werewolfs are unstoppable. (Of course, you can craft an effective anti-werewolf deck, but it will be unbalanced against normal opponents.)UPD October 2018: Bethesda found a new developer to rebuild the client from scratch, and what they have done is terrible. The old app was so much better. I don't mean visuals and interface - it is a matter of taste after all (although I do think that now the game looks more generic). It is just full of bugs and glitches, at some point I even was worried that the new client discarded my progress, as I started receiving titles I had already earned. I play on a touch screen, which worked very well in the old client. Now it is hardly possible.Well, they are likely to fix bugs, but problems with balance (damn OP werewolfs) remain. I do enjoy playing arena, though. It might be frustrating when you cannot compile a decent deck, but at least everyone is equal in this mode and having a new deck every time is refreshing. It is quite accessible, you can afford it wiht gold from daily quests without great grind.I did not really apreciated the Morrowind update either. IMHO they overcomplicated gameplay. The puzzles mode is cool, however.Still 5/10",0
1097,"Early Access Revieweven in the current (beta/unfinished) status this game shows a lot of potential. i jumped in for a quick battle & ended up playing all night. this is not typically the kind of game i would play, but it was quite fun and addicting.crafts are unique, have thier own style and are customisable on top of that. at this point there are not a lot of options, heck, some ships have none, but i guess some of that is to be expected on a work on progress title.there is also a leveling & craft upgrade system, but it appears to be more of a placeholder at this point than fully functional.i have not noticed any ""pay to win"" elements so far, while there dos appear to be a ""premium"" option (ala-robocraft etc..), it speeds up progression but do not give any advantage a non-paying player can aquire (with more time investment) graphics & effects look good, though they may be taxing on lower end systems.  i have not tried the game on a low end PC so i cant comment how well performance scales. but its pretty darn good looking & i have a hard time believing it will look as good on a entry level setup.TLDR. game is awesome, but still has some places that need work, if you can deal with that & dont mind paying to support development of a game that will eventually be free/F2P, then go for it. (i believe there are plans to reward early suporters) ",1
13313,"A fun sandbox/voxel game a la minecraft-esque.I would not recommend upgrading to the pro version as it is not worth the money. The devs have spoken on adding more to the pro version but you essentially get a worthless light that doesn't really illuminate anything and can follow you around and you also get a glider. The glider is VERY wonky and seems out of place in the game. I would have preferred a jet pack as I think that at least would help when building higher structures. You get the ability to mess with your world options in the pro version and can increase the treasure drop rate or mess with low-gravity to name a few.The game feels sort of like it is in early access. There is not a ton of monster variety and there is a small pool of craftable items. I do have to dock some points also for putting crafting materials behind a paywall. If you want a steampunk home, the only way to get those blocks is with real money and that is not the route the devs should be going down.What this game does well is blueprints. If you are like me and lack imagination for a structure. Purchase a blueprint (with either real money or crafting materials you find in game) and then find the materials and fill in the blocks (think, paint-by-numbers) to then create and complete the blueprint into a functioning dwelling! You can also pay to receive all the materials for that blueprint instead of finding/crafting them yourself. With the latest update, they have added Steam workshop functionality for blueprints so I am excited to see what users can create and share.Overall, this is a free game at its core and it does a pretty good job of getting off the ground. Hopefully, the pro purchasers get more for their money and more content/enemies/crafting gets added (pets fighting with you!) and they remove the paywall of certain materials being real money only. I would be OK with them moving that content to the pro version and then you can still craft the materials or if you want to shell out money and have them given to you then be my guest. Pro should give you access to the entire game. Period. They should only be asking for more money to remove the hindrance/time it takes to gather the materials.TL;DR Free, fun game. A little basic, needs more content, skip the pro version.",1

I've put in two and a half hours with a friend which was well worth it, the combat system puts most other MMO's to shame in my honest opinion unless you're the type that likes quickbars and endless rows of abilities. You have a chance to dodge melee attacks as a Ranger ( Haven't played any other class.) which is nice, it brings a similar mechanic as Dark Souls into play which I find extremely well thought out. My advice: Try it out if you have free space on your computer, you're not losing money if you simply TRY. IT. OUT. Don't take the people's opinion that wouldn't reccomend this game, take it into your own judgement. In all honesty I give the game a 8/10 why not a perfect score?

10549,"I would like to make one thing about this review very clear, it is mostly my OPINION here and unless otherwise stated does not contain many facts.1. It REQUIRES patiance, if you go in guns blazing and running around like a chicken with it's head cut off your not going to have a good time.2. The community is mostly great with a few bad apples here and there, but if your nice and respectful to other players most will help you learn to play.3. This is the closest thing to a hunting simulator as of this review, so if your looking to shoot the biggest buck in the game only a couple hours in, then you had better go somewhere else.4. If you really, REALLY, want to play this game and play it a lot, than you going to end up spending money on it. How much you spend is up to you, I personally think the prices they ask for ingame items are very reasonable. One package comes with over 10 weapons and a years worth of membership for around $50. Plus even after your membership expires you keep the guns, and just the membership is around $30 for 12 months.5. If your willing to put in the time to learn how to play, then it is a very rewarding game. even after 270+ hours I still am learning things about the game. I recommend it to anyone who has some patiance and likes games where skill matters and shows. But if your looking for Cod like action then don't waste your time.",1
1121,"Early Access Review     This game seriously deserves more than 76% positive ratings. For an alpha game, the graphics on the ships are flawless, and trust me, only having 1 map doesn't make the game tedious since the fun doesn't come from pretty scenery, it comes from great plays and battles. It's a complicated rock-papers-scissors that requires coordination and strategy even if the idea is simple.      My only gripe is the tech and upgrade trees, how one has to unlock a certain ship or ability when their end goal is a different ship or ability. The ships and abilities are sidegrades anyways, fitting your playstyle so why not be able to directly unlock the ship/ability you want?     Overall, a wonderful game that's only going to get better. One worth sinking your harpoon (yes you heard me right) into.",1

More and more glitches and failures build up, and they keep slowly slowly developing only things that can be purchased.At this point, I think it is safe to conclude that they will never get this game fully launched out of beta, unless they hire some new programmers as well as some kind of quality assurance. Despite the thousands of bug reports they get, despite all the discussions on Facebook and Twitter, all identifying exact bugs that are severe and hinder gameplay significantly, they do not even so much as respond, let alone actually fix anything.This game, very sadly, I believe is going vaporware, and will never see its way out of beta.",0

13343,"Until now i have always stayed far away from these types of building games. I couldnt really get into Minecraft due to the graphics. Once i saw this left Early Access i decided to try it since it was free anyway. I really enjoyed it out of the gate. Great building, good shapes, good graphics, good stability. The first hours are fun where you continuously unlock more and more recipes. 300+ in total. After spending 10-15 hours on free mode i decided to invest and buy Pro. To support the company to hopefully further improve the game.Is everything great? No.Pro:- Easy to learn, hard to master.- Lots of diverse recipes- Looks greatCon:- The Pro status price can be a bit steep for people- Some types of buildings locks behind Coins ( ingame premium currency). Completely optional!- Small glitches but nothing game-breaking so far- So many servers, that it is hard to find heavily populated serversMost negative parts come from the financial side of things. The free to play version allows access to alot of options in the game building wise. Server wise you are kind of restricted. FTP version does allow you to get a real sense of the game.If people want this game to improve the people making this game also need support. Is this game playable without Pro? Absolutely. But if you plan to invest more than a few hours into it, Pro is really worth the cost.TLDR; Good game, Pro is worth it.  ",1

10497,"DO NOT READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. PLEASE READ THIS FIRST. This is a very good hunting game. As a real life hunter, I enjoy the level of realism this game provides. It's not realistic in many ways, but it's not a hunting sim (even though I wish it was). That being said, it's certainly the most realistic hunting game on the market. It has a wide variety of environments, weapons, species, and equipment. It has incredible graphics, good AI, awesome online multiplayer, real-time competitions, interesting missions, decent skill system with acheivements, a photo gallery of your kills, and decent statistics tracking. The gameplay is fun while remaining somewhat realistic, but it does have a learning curve. Once you understand how the game works, you'll have a blast. The negative reviews almost all come from people who did not read what they were downloading. They thought this was a completely free game without doing any research into it. theHunter DOES have a subscription based system and microtransactions, but it's not all bad. They just updated their F2P model and it is more than fair now. Keep reading.As I write this review, currently there are 10 maps, 29 huntable species, and one species of dog you can bring hunting with you. When you download the game for free as a guest you are able to access all maps. However, you can only hunt 5 species for free (whitetail deer, pheasant, and three rabbit species). The free species are on all but one map. All other species require a license that you can either earn by doing missions for in-game currency (gm$) or buy with real money (em$). You can even earn em$ by doing sponsor deals (which I have not done, so I can't tell you whether or not I recommend it). You cannot shoot animals you don't have a license for. You are given two weapons (12GA Single Shot Shotgun and .243 Bolt-Action Rifle with unlimited ammo) and a few other items for free to start your hunting. This shotgun is legal for every species in the game as long as you're using the correct shells (birdshot, buckshot, or slugs), the rifle is legal for mid-sized animals including the Whitetail. Check the wiki for more information.Between the missions for the 5 free species, you can earn plenty of gm$ to purchase a host of equipment to improve your chances of being successful, and even buy licenses for additional species. That's all without spending any real money. This route should be considered more of a demo to the full game, as it teaches you about the basics of what the game has to offer. Once you're convinced that the full version is worth the money, you can purchase a membership bundle or subscription. Subscribers unlock all animals, maps, and unlimited free ammunition for the duration of their subscription. Bundles are the best value if you're just getting into the game, however. Bundles include a subscription and a host of weapons and equipment. I would HIGHLY recommend the Trailrunner Bundle ($49.99), which includes a year's subscription and a HOST of weapons and equipment. When your year's subsription is ending, you can renew your subscription for another full year for only $34.99. There are tons of extra weapons and equipment you can buy a-la-carte with em$ (real money). I've spent an absolutely ridiculous amount of money on this game and I don't regret it. I love hunting and this is the best hunting game out there. You don't have to spend a ton of money to enjoy it though. You can have fun for free or take it up to a great time for $49.99. The subscription is fair and necessary because the devs are CONSTANTLY updating the game and adding new maps, species, and other features. Even if you don't want to spend money on the game, you can download what is a great free whitetail deer hunting game.Before you go trashing a great game, do some research on what you're actually getting into. It is not fair at all to the devs or long-time players who want this game to be supported for years to come. There is a wiki and forum for learning and getting involved in theHunter's great community. Happy Hunting, all. theHunter Wiki[www.thehunterwiki.com]theHunter Forums[forum.thehunter.com]Trailrunner Bundle ",1

361,"Early Access ReviewIt isn't the most scary game out there, but it's effective and interesting. The game starts to convince you to feel that it is a joke, and isn't supposed to be actually scary. Then, something silly catches you off guard and startles you. You laugh it off, embarressed. Then, there come Spooky's ""specimens,"" which are startling and not cute, which the you might not expect. The game adds more depth with a few references and rooms with silly morbid mini-games, which emphasizes how much you should actually fear ""Spooky."" Spooky is a very adorable character, too. I love her design and how she too seems like a joke at first, but then you start to realize she's pretty evil and crazy. (I have a playtime of only about 10 minutes because I'm having trouble getting the newest build to display properly, I've played this a while ago before it's steam release.)",1

14509,"Early Access ReviewI liked Robocraft when I played it about two years ago.Now I can say that I sorta hate it.Everything that was good about the game has been crushed and everything that was bad has gone worse.At the beginning we had a Tier System that differed experienced players from players that need help finding their own♥♥♥♥♥♥when they need to take a♥♥♥♥♥♥This is gone.Now we only have one tier - tier crap.I kinda grinded to the top level guns and the tier 10 cubes because I wanted to play with grown up individuals that now how to play and that took some time. Then the system was changed but i still had fun, sometimes.WIth the latest patch the game absolutely got destroyed. The crate-reward-model is pointless and P2W ... but I can't hardly see anyone pay money for this game because the matchmaking system is even worse than the new P2W model.What do I want from a game?To have fun!How do I have fun in a game?To compete with other individuals that match my skill in a fair enviroment and to play together with people that also match my skill.I want the game to be challenging and I want to be rewarded for my efforts to fight my team to victory.This is gone, it's all gone.The matchmaking system is extremely stupid and destroys the game in it's basic principles.So it's impossible to have a fair match because of people dropping out of teams and not getting replaced. Or the enemies team has like a four person squad that knows how to play and stomps you into the ground. Or the enemies team is just significantly better rolled.From ten matches I lose like seven and now to the worst thing, everytime I lose a rank aswell, that means, I can't get higher than silver ... thats where I start grinding my teeth. I would say, that I built a decent bot that has proven it's concept since the early alpha. I am always one of the three top players of my team. But I kinda always lose a rank because of the poor match making mechanics that suck me in an abyss and I have no chance to overcome that. Not by skill, not by effort.This makes the game not only pointless for me, it becomes a raging hell of frustration.I can not recommend this game to anyone who isn't a jerk or likes to feel eternal frustration.But heeeey the graphics look nice, the building system is very cool, the game types have a lot of potential.But this is worth nothing until the match making system has been fixed.I quit. Bye Robocraft and burn in hell!You can check out my tank by searching for ""Love Machine"" in the Robocraft bot show off♥♥♥♥♥♥""My english maybe suck but that's ok, i'm german.",0

2167,"It’s not so much the gameplay that is challenging, but your knowledge of the game itself that challenges you. There are many nuances in the game that you have to learn. First the vocabulary. For example: ""5% increased damage"" is very different from ""5% more damage"". And because of this don’t expect to make that perfect char your first go. Especially if you don’t follow a guide. This isn't really a bad thing, but it is not friendly to new players.What is bad are the tags they put on skills. They basically mean nothing. For example ""rain of arrows"" is a skill that has the projectile tag, but a projectile support skill will not affect this skill. Such as “Greater/lesser projectiles” do absolutely nothing to this skill. It's like GGG wants it to be confusing just because they can make it confusing. I don’t see any other reason for it. It’s why a totem skill can have the tag spell, but things that effect spells don’t effect it. So they make the learning curve even more stupid. And if you go post this as a bug on the forums. You just get trolled and yelled at for being an idiot.The point of the game is to make the most OP character you can. I enjoy doing this, and is the reason I started to play the game. However; even if you succeed in making a character work the way you wanted it too. Don’t expect it to last. GGG has been constantly removing build options. The build diversity has gone way down sense the game first released. And you may not even be able to play your character even remotely close to the way you did before. There is way more to this then simply nerfing stuff. If it was a simple nerf and the build still worked I wouldn’t put this in the review.GGG is on a never ending quest to balance the game. As if things HAVE to be balanced. Meaning anything main stream or popular gets nerfed. In 1.3 it was block. In Awakening it was life leach, and auras. And many other things. Anyways; the point of nerfs where to balance things. But there not balancing things. They are removing options. If block just became less OP instead of them removing most of the different ways of getting it. I would have been ok with it. But the truth is they can’t really balance defensive vs offensive skills. If you want an explanation on that read here http://www.diabloii.net/blog/comments/mad-prophecies-2-defensive-skills But in GGG’s quest to balance these, they instead have made it so you need multiple defensive things going instead of one.For example Chaos damage. Chaos damage has its own special rules. It bypasses your energy shield for free. Is the hardest defensive of stat to get in the game, and it is very punishing on specific builds. For some builds the only way around it is to hope for a supper rare, and expensive item drop. Recently GGG has upped the item’s drop rate. But it doesn’t really help you get the item if your build needs it. As many maps will just give you snakes or something that does Chaos damage. Even after you re-rolled the map just to avoid the mod of poison damage. This means you’re never going to get the item you need without buying it.GGG has nerfed a defensive stat out of oblivion every major patch. Currently the only real strategy defensively that works is DPS. Yep you just got to get so much DPS you can, and kill everything before it hits you.Patches are a big problem for existing characters. For example: Reduce Mana used to work on auras. But in the awakening patch... Reduced Mana changed so it wouldn’t work with auras or similar gems. They then took the enlightened gem and made it do what reduced mana used to do. This is a huge problem for existing builds. The biggest problem being the color of gem changing. Many people might have corrupted their gear, and can’t change the color gem sockets anymore. Meaning your once level 100 character is now all messed up gear and gems. GGG just expects you to level a new guy. And when they mess up your character they don’t let you redo in game key choices. Like the bandit reward choice. They only give you a passive re-spec. And that is only because they change the passive tree so much. It is usually impossible to leave your old tree in tack.That is my biggest gripe of this game. Many people like this. They think it keeps the game fresh. But for many others... GGG is just destroying builds constantly patch after patch. And you as the player you are just expected to deal with it. Builds come and go. I don’t see this changing, and it will just continue be so. Until the least popular build is the only viable one. Meaning any work you put into creating a build will go to waste. Even if the build isn't that good.GGG don’t like specific build so much that they have over tuned their bosses and other things. For example: They didn’t like life leach so much that they made it so bosses can one shot you. There reason for this is because they don’t want you to take a hit and just be able to heal back up for free. So how do players get around this? There are two options. One is make your char supper mobile and avoid the hit all together. Or make your char supper tanky enough to survive the hit and then life steal back up. That’s right in there attempt to punish a specific build they made it pretty much one of the only viable builds. This just goes to show you that the people in charge of balance at GGG have no clue what they are doing.Also patch changes are not announced before they happen either. However; beta/test realm testers get to play with the changes before anyone else. And most of the major changes can be found in the form of rumors. But the actual patch notes come the same day as the patch. Leaving many builds broken in their wake. And forum jerks going around telling people they had plenty of time to prepare. This gives beta testers a big advantages in many different areas of the game. Like what items to buy, or sell based off upcoming nerfs/buffs. Even way before the patch notes, let alone the patch release. But the biggest annoyance is the race events. Right after a huge major patch like the awakening. They will offer prizes. Such as a laptop to the first person to kill the new boss. They highly show favoritism to a few select people. Weather they realize it or not. So if you don't cheat and are not able to play on the test servers. Then don't expect to win anything. EVER!!!Most people will be happy; until the next patch comes out, and your character is completely gutted again. Because of this I don’t recommend picking up any of the bandit rewards. Just kill all 3. It leaves you with more flexibility; for when the next patch does come out. And don’t spend money on the game. It’s not a matter of “if they will” but “when they will” destroy your current character/build. Very few builds survive from patch to patch. One of the patches actually de-leveled your gems for you. (Yep GGG said you know all those corrupted high level gems you had. Well too bad you have to make new ones now.) This is a game where patches are your worst nightmare.Other things to note are: PVP go ranged or loose. Don’t expect to do groups/parties. The reward isn’t worth the penalties that come with it. Don’t ever corrupt stuff except for gems. Because gems change not just in stats, but in color too. Meaning you will most likely be leveling new ones anyways.Also avoid the forums. GGG will lock your game account for what you say in the forums. Not just your forum account, if they don’t like what you say. This is 100% true. You don’t have to believe me. Just read their terms of use. They locked my account for over a year because they didn't like this review. I originally wrote it on their website, and had to move it here later. It was a Big mistake!",0
12407,Early Access ReviewFirst off... the optimization. the game defaulted to my integrated graphics card... (you can test this by disableing your integrated card... if the game does launch it will run much worse)second the action combat was not implemented for all the classes... third the cash shop... if i pay $30-$40 i dont wana have the game charge me extra for consumeable items.really did they should have just delayed the launch... everyone was expecting what they saw in the gameplay videos... and what we got was broken... (i will be watching this game to see if it fixes its issues but as of right now i wouldnt even play it if it was free),0
12269,"Early Access ReviewGood game with alot of potential, devs are working incredibly hard and quick to provide updates! Tons of people jumped on the hate wagon for launch issues(which 95% of them have been resolved)",1
9000,"penthouse side : 2 should be the title of this Treyarch title because it is literal♥♥♥♥♥♥ there are no killstreaks for one, (1- ) and microsoft really dropped the ball by not letting u be a gangster in this one.  the multiplayer in this game is a complete letdown bc there is no dlc, but onto the SINGLE player : you play as a grandma living in ancient rome during the roman emnpire ruling of rome era and due to the oppression from greek alexander the great you cant have sex with other old men and the entire game you go around collecting collectables and flying helicopters and there are no dogs like there should be as such in call of duty and the guns are unbalanced9/11 it was the bomb gameinformer",1
4226,"This is definitely a PAY TO WIN game. I put in about 100+ hours on android and I knew that it was P2W from the start. They rig the cards you draw. I literally filled it with mostly monsters and only drew only my spell cards in a row. I had 50% monsters and 50% spells/traps and literally kept getting only spells or only monsters. I even made it 70% monsters and 30% spells/traps and STILL got nothing but spells somehow. I was only using the Peak Performance skill the entire time.I even put multiple copies of the same card only to draw every other card except duplicates. I even experimented my card draws with a friend only to draw every other card except for my most powerful cards which were always conveniently placed at the very bottom of my deck. I have mostly played with my friends and they literally saw it on my livestream that I would draw similar cards during my 1st or 2nd turn and we even played about 30-40 matches in a row only to happen every single time.They even rigged the dice roll cards to give you the worst dice rolls as much as possible. Because these cards are so powerful that they would stomp most cards that are mostly locked behind a paywall. It goes against their profit motive to simply rely on skill for using the right cards at the right moment. I have the Dangerous Machine Type-6 and it LITERALLY gave me a #6 dice roll 18 times in a row across all my matches always self-destructing my card each time. I only got to use it to it's full effect only 2 times and the rest was nothing but 1 or 6.I mostly played with my friends and even when they had cards more powerful than mine I have won more matches against them. This just proves how massively rigged the RNG system is and did my own personal research. The math doesn't make any sense and pretty much forces you to buy the most OP decks behind the paywall. If you are F2P be prepared to lose a lot of matches and do a ton of grinding to unlock ""skills"". If you don't believe that the card draws are rigged they literally have a feature called ""skills"" that can be applied to your character.How is this a skill when you literally give a player an advantage to pull certain cards out of their♥♥♥♥♥that cmpletely breaking the game. What a joke! Here is a list of the ""skills"" below.BalanceIf your deck consists of 10 monster cards and 10 spell/trap cards, you will have 2 monster and 2 spell/trap in starting hand.Draw Sense: Spell/TrapCan be used each time your Life Points decrease by 1800. In the Draw Phase, instead of doing a normal draw, draw a random Spell/Trap card.Destiny DrawCan be used each time your Life Points decrease by 2000. In the Draw Phase, instead of doing a normal draw, draw the card of your choice.Draw Sense: High LevelCan be used each time your Life Points decrase by 1800. In the Draw Phase, instead of doing a normal draw, draw a random level 7 or more monster.Heavy StarterIf your Deck has 3 or more Level 5 or higher monsters with different names, you will have improved chance of having a Level 5 or higher monster in your starting hand..",0

2857,"I can't really recommend this game as long as they keep the shell bounce mechanic in.  Basically it doesn't matter if the target is paper, at certain angles you have a flat percentage to bounce a shot regardless of your penetration or the armor of the target.  Might as well be playing a dice game instead of what has been marketed as one dedicated to realism.",0

11902,"Early Access ReviewI don't understand why this game gets so much hate. It is a solid MMO with high production value. It is a typical Asian MMO without the P2W crap (as of now). If you enjoy other asian MMO games, chances are you are going to like this one.Some GOOD elements:- Very nice character models, skills effects and animations- Combat feels good but it can be improved further (Good if you like tab targeting, if looking for ""action"" combat look elsewhere)- Good taming system. Many mounts and pets to catch and upgrade.- The most important thing imho, NOT P2W (as of now).Some BAD elements:- Very BAD optimization out of the box. FPS is quite unstable. Requires manual .ini file changes to improve FPS (Still not great tho)- Graphically dated and unimpressive areas/zones.- NOT END GAME content is available as of now.- Bad localization (text translation). If you're looking for a new MMO and you LIKE eastern mmo games, give it a try. You can also wait to see if the soon to be released end game content is worth your hard earned money.Also please expect a good amount of changes and improvements over time. This game is in Early Access (for our version)",1
15703,Early Access ReviewVery good game BUT the hardest part is the grinding at level 14-15 because it takes 738k XP to level up and it just seems too much. From level 13-14 is about 70k XP so I would want the level system to get more looked at!  ,1
12577,"Let me start by saying, first off, you have to be prepared to spend a lot of money if you want to play more than what seems like a ""DEMO"" of the game.  Second, I got a few issues with the physics when using a game pad.  It is very twitchy even with light throttle on every car when you are not in 3rd gear or higher.  I have been on race tracks and in real race cars.  You can tell when you are getting close to the edge of the handling capabilities.  This game seems to either give you massive understeer, then when you manage to make a corner, you got the twitching problem when trying to get power down out of the corners.  I find myself having to be in one or two gears higher than I should be just to keep control of the physics at the lower speeds.  Having a spedometer when you are outside of the car would help also.  The only way you can get a speedometer or tachometer is to have your view from inside the car.",0
5605,"Why on earth is this here? This is a mobile game, just go download the PC/Mac version on Wargaming's website which actually has a resolution higher than a potato.

14079,"Okay so first off I owned the game back in the day before its name change and eventual shutdown. I can honestly say that this free to play version is just as good if not better than the original game. Yes there are bugs, yes there are hackers (they are getting banned more frequently than people think), but you have to remember that it also is under new management and has just recently been released. There are tons of items all across the map (some places seem too have way too many). If you are looking for a game similar to H1Z1 (I own that too); this is it. I mean you cant really get any better than free to play. Everything can be found/bought in game without spending real money. Now if you want special skins and that sort of thing you can either find them or buy them with real money but thats about it. The only real complaints I have is that you are bright green when you spawn in and extremely visible to other players around you, and the game crashes every now and then. Overall a really fun game, especially with friends. The developers will fix the bugs, stop complaining about bugs on a free to play game. Its not like you paid for it to work 100%. It will get better, give it a chance!",1
3,"Great game, fun and colorful and all that.A side note, though: When are we getting windowed mode? My computer hates fullscreen so.... yeah. The computer doesn't like to run this. Shame, because this is really enjoyable. But until then, I guess I'll settle for more Skyrim. Cheers!",1

14433,"Early Access ReviewWAS the Awesomenes Construction Simulator 2014. That is what this game WAS. Note that I'm a Tier 9 and have just recently played this game to update my review.I have Built:M-35 Mako from Mass Effect 1M-44 Hammerhead from Mass Effect 2.UT-47A Kodiak from Mass Effect 3.Terran Diamondback from Starcraft 2.Terran Arâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥e Mercenary Siege Tank. (YES. THE SIEGE BREAKER FROM WINGS OF LIBERTY.)But none of that matters when the base physics of the game have been modified from what was established, the weapons continuously nerfed until being 6 feet under, Rewards being lowered with ""Improvments to the system"", and a plethora of other problems.Back in early 2014 I STRONGLY, I repeat, STRONGLY supported this game. STRONGLY, I emphasize this, say it with me. STRONGLY... SUPPORTED THIS GAME. But with every step forward, FreeJam has shown they intend to take two steps back every time.- ""Clone Wars""So let's first start off with the removal of all the nice cool gadgets that were originally available right at the start. This included the Hoverblades, Plasma launchers, Railguns, and thrusters. From level 1 upward of Level 3. Yes, this happened. Freejam didn't change THIS until 7 months later, when people stopped crying and moaning for it to come back.- ""Double Edged Butt-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ery""Now PRIOR to this, they also made some modifications to the reward system, adding a ""Repair function"" to the game, which put a drain on casual players Tiers 6 and up back then. What was the kick in the balls here? a 25% decrease in rewards. Yes, BOTH RP and TP (Robopoints and Techpoints).- ""Hero Zero"" Next up was the ""Hero System"", which allowed you to get the full RP and TP from a match you died in if your team won, but WAIT! ...At the cost of the entire reward system getting another 25% decrease. At this point, managing to make enough money to get new parts was an uphill battle, and at a 50% reward decrease that has remained permanent to this day, It's been a massive pain in theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ - ""Turn up for Hate""Now, next up, THEY REMOVE repair cost, yet YET again, ANOTHER FREAKING REWARD QUANTITY DECREASE. You getting the pattern yet? Don't worry I'll explain it in a second. At this point, it got rediculous, but oh no, there's even MORE. - ""From Intense to Indense""This game was always a One-life team Death Match game. The ""Respawned and Overclocked"" update has killed everything that made it original and turned it into a confused MOBA wannabe. Even worse, is that they've now set the original mode, now named ""Classic"" So far on the back burner it can take from 5 minutes to 3 hours just to get on a match, gradually decreasing the time needed to even get into one with each tier you go up. But here's the final blow to the old mode: A 80% decrease at this point... To the profit you make from it. ""Classic"" is now as worthwhile as dumping yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in a toilet...Or on a development team. Think that's the worst part? Oh no. I'm not even FINISHED. - ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING KEYBOARD!?!""The controls with any movement design other than Tank treads will feel so obliterated you will literally ask... Yeah that's right, the subtitle of this paragraph. As of the R&O Update, Wheels are incredibly sluggish, Rockets provide minimal momentum, hoverblades are highly unstable if you lose even ONE, Aerofoils are a disaster to use, Walker legs are bloody hell to even keep still on a ceiling or a steep hill if you want to stay in place, and believe me, it's going to walk down to the surface on you while you shoot. And LASTLY, the rotor blade design is sluggish as well.THISâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥GENUINELY BRINGS MY P!SS TO A PLASMATIC BOIL. THE CHALLENGE SHOULD NOT BE IN HANDICAPPING THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PLAYER. - ""GIVE US UR MONIES!""Why all the reward debuffs? Because they want money. They want to FORCE THE PLAYERBASE to purchase premium currency so that they can accelerate their growth to a level they can remotely tolerate. This game never DID have a fair free to play model, but it is now skewed beyond any conceivable belief. And also, No, it's not even classified as Pay to Win. IT'S PAY TO â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PROGRESS. - ""GIVE US UR MONIES 2!!1""The introduction of Easy Anti Cheat, or EAC. Instead of using Steam's VAC system which worked very well and still mostly does, made no sense either. They decided to use a third party system, that not only people have always second-guessed, but never trusted, and never been comfortable with. You see where this is going? Yeah. They drove off a number of their player base stating, ""If you can't get into Robocraft to play because of EAC, that is a small price to pay for the issue of Hackers trying to ruin our game"". The only people who tried to help fix this was EAC themselves as I recall, and even THEN, only under the pressure of the Robocraft community, which had already started leaving. - ""GIVE US UR FERKIGN MUNEEZ!!11!ELEVEN!""WHY did EAC have to fix it? Because Freejam was too dumbfounded watching the stars shine out of their fat frigging assh0les to do it themselves, aside from the matter of the development company's profoundly horrendous inexperience in stopping hackers in the first place. But it doesn't even end there. They won't respond to crticism kindly, light or dark, which is why i'm not sugarcoating this. Not even an ounce. They won't listen to reason, no matter how kindly you put it. If they don't like yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you better be prepared for the ban hammer, because they silence ANY AND ALL FEEDBACK that involves any kind of actual review with a VENGEANCE. And hell, this hasn't even ended yet. Keep reading. This is starting to look like the Robocraft Holocaust. *shudder* - ""Nerf 'em to the Grave""Now, the FINAL kick to the balls here, and you might not get up from this one, is the repeated nerfing of weapons that have performed perfectly fine, and the buffing of weapons that never even needed a buff. FINALLY, there's the issue of rendering certain vehicular designs completely obsolete, promoting the uncreative design of Gun Bricks with tank treads, and tank treads only. I'll give an example. - ""From Speedy to Needy""I made a vehicle called ""The Masterkill B@stard"" (Frankly can't put the word itself in) Which operated on two things: Wheels + downforce, and rocket asssisted forward momentum. As of 3 days after the R&O update, my speedy little vehicle is no faster than a Treaded Tank, and that's WITH the thrusters on. I guess people can't stand having to exercize their arms, hands and fingers with the corsshairs on their Railguns and enjoy the game, because this actually happened. WITHOUT rockets, it's even SLOWER than a tank. Believe me, i've tested this one the day I learned of the horror inflicted on the Physics engine, which I think it's safe to say, it's nearly nonexistant now. - ""Final Thoughts""Lastly, like i said, I STRONGLY... STRONGLY! SUPPORTED THIS GAME! Hell, I even put $10 into this game just for hangar bays! But as of now? FreeJam has botched their game so much, yielded to the manipulation of their own community so badly, that it is nigh-unenjoyable. This game had SO MUCH POTENTIAL a year ago. But now it's all been dried up. Freejam has made it evidently clear they don't want to take a step in the right direction. A year ago, i'd give this game a 9.5 out of 10. But as of now, I can only - in good conscience - give it a 4 out of 10. A toxic community, confused development team, nonsensical gameplay, poor teamplay or constant nerfs as a double-edge to updates, and absolutely horrible physics engine tortured to death by modification of what it once was, ALL IN THE NAME, of staying away from making the game overall better simple for personal profit, keeps me from daring touch this awful nightmare any more after this. Stay. Away. From this hideous deformed child of a game. You will be stricken with it's Gods-awful MOBA wannabe gameplay.[More on my Review in the Comments section]",0

9403,"Permadeath game warning!  If you die, you have to start over with the lowest equipment and at level 1.Realm of the Mad God is a game of skill, if you can't develop the skills to play this, you may not enjoy this game.With all that said, RotMG is one of the most addicting games I have ever played.  It is simple yet elegant in design.  Start on the beach and work your way towards the center of Oryx's realm where the strongest monsters dwell.  Along the way you will face a constant stream of monsters, all of whom are intent on turning you into their next meal.  There are quests of varying difficulty, some you can solo but others you may need to gang up on with your fellow adventurers.The combat is point-and-click.  You aim and fire with your mouse, use spacebar for your special ability and you move with WADSQ.  There are 14 classes to choose from, each with it's own special ability and stat cap.You start at level 1, and can reach level 20 in a short amount of time.  Then the game really begins.  The gods in godlands have a chance of dropping potions which can raise one of your stats by 1 point.  The goal here is to max your stats to increase your damage output, defenses and regeneration ability.  The stat potions not found in the godlands can be found in dungeons dropped by the gods or by some of the quest events.  There are 8 stats in all, which you can potentially max.Equipment can be found everywhere.  From the lowlands to the godlands you will find gear of increasing strength.  Delving into the dungeons, you will find even more powerful equpment.  Equipment, Skill and stats are the 3 most important things when playing this game.Once certain requirements are met, Oryx(the antagonist in this game) will seal the Realm and summon all players to his castle in order to wipe you out once and for all.  Will he succeed?  That's up to you.When you first play this game, you will have 7 days to buy into a very good deal.  +2 character slots and +3 vault chests, as well as 2600 gold(+5 chests is recommended) and a penguin pet.  It is recommended that you use a spare email address to make a test account directly on the website realmofthemadgod.com (not on steam), to see if you like the game.  If you like it, either continue to play through the website or make a Steam account.  Having multiple character slots and vault chests available really helps because of the permadeath nature of this game.  You can stock up spare equipment and stat pots in the chests and you can play multiple classes when you have more character slots.  They have sales on character slots and vault chests relatively often, and those are the only things you'd want to spend money on..everything else is a waste because it is either consumable or will die with your character(backpacks are worth getting even though they die with you).  Don't bother with the Steam DLC pack, it's not worth it.I play this game almost exclusively(through the website).  It's a lot of fun and is a near-continuous adrenaline rush.  I'll reiterate, this is a game of skill and is not for everyone.  Be sure to try it before investing your time and money into it.",1
17184,its a good game but for kids who play it i dont see them staying due to the heavy pay to win feeling in order to get a better dragon then the starting ones without paying to be a vip you could do this right ifyou made it so titan class was a vip thing but made titan just faster not like oh you need to buy this to be cool but if that ever happend with alot of things made cheaper without the pay to win maybe even make it so you have to buy the game for like 2 or 5 bucks you would have alot more players then again world of warcraft if doing this and well it still alive right,1

3844,"Team Fortress 2 used to be a good game in like older times, well I stopped playing the game nearly 3 years ago but now it seems to gotten much worse since I stopped. Here's what I don't like about the game:THE COMMUNITYThis has been a problem since the beginning, and making it free to play (even when I started as a free to play) made it even worse. They expect you to be 100% perfect at the game and if you don't stay up to par with your team, they will blame most things on you, even when you didn't seem to do anything. They also have a chance to make fun of you if you have no hats or taunts or anything, which according to them, if you have no items in the game, you're obviously a bad player, and if you have a backpack filled with rare items and is worth like thousands of dollars, you're automatically considered a pro at the game.There's the players who are way too good at the game, which ruin the fun by taking all of the kills and making the opposing team scared and, of course, making them rage. Most of the time, someone calls a vote to scramble the teams, or they go into spectate mode and wait 3 hours just so they can join the other team. I honestly think that people are easily enraged by this simple game.MICROTRANSACTIONSAnother way of slaying people's wallets and life savings. This has become a common thing in many games today, which does include PAYDAY 2 and Killing Floor 2, but I honestly think this game has the most microtransactions. They seem to be almost like getting addicted to a drug, your brain just wants more and more of it, and if you don't get enough, you suffer withdrawl and end up wasting your money on something virtual instead of something better you could buy in real life. I think there's even, for example, a skin for a knife for the Spy costs more than a knife in real life.GAMEPLAYI guess the gameplay is what keeps many players involved. The gameplay is not actually that bad, but it's mostly ruined simply by the community. The game is also considered very unbalanced from what I have heard with the new update. Competitive and Casual appear to be very unbalanced, commonly from the opposing team class-stacking (having multiple players play as the same class as one another). The XP system is also dumb, because the only way to get XP from games is by winning, nothing but winning. You get a kill? Nope, no XP for you.The gameplay may apply with what I said earlier in the community, with how some players are so skilled at the game that they take the fun out of it and make the enemy team scatter. There's no separate servers that are for skilled players only, and there aren't too many assets that indicate a skilled player.2/10 - Definitely do not recommend playing this game for thousands of hours ... or even hundreds.",0
6415,Early Access ReviewTruly this game isn't worth it. Just the grind for money to get a decent gun is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ I for one bought the Mosin-Nagant for my Soviet character and it turns out that it takes 2 shots to the head if they use a certain badge. Being as how it's just as bad of a grind if you want to be a pilot or something (which they fixed recently i guess.) But all they keep doing is adding more guns and more tanks to the game which are still UNBALANCED to everyone and every gun that's already in the game. I've played a decent amount of the game which is probably more than I should have played but for what I thought the game had some potential which they're not showing anymore. Feel free to try out this game! I'd rather play TF2 again...,0

14436,"a long time ago the game was fun and simple. To be honest when they reworked a lot of the mechanics and transitioned it over to a loot crate system I still had fun with the game. I knew the loot crates were cash grabs but if you won games and did well you got good crates. log in daily get a protonium crate. You still get♥♥♥♥♥♥ even at the bare minimum of taking 2 minutes out of your day to load the game up and close it again.But I came back to the game the other day here after not having played in a long time. The 8v8 or whatever game mode with the towers and the map variety is gone. all that is left is a 5v5 game mode on the same claustraphobic map that i never liked to begin with. It doesn't have towers that you shoot, just cap points you sit on. The enemy base isn't your target, you jut cap and wait for time. It's not fun anymore. At least when the loot crates were first introduced it was still fun to play. Yeah getting legendary equipment took a while if you didn't get extremely lucky, but you didn't need it to have a decent bot and have fun.",0
7700,"The game was of a mediocre kind of Dungeons and Dragons Skyrim sort of Minecraft knock-off, but it was fairly on the better side of knock-offs, but that's also one of many reasons why I'm giving it a bad review.  The game itself is fairly fun, minus the ungodly amount of lag, and all the in-app purchases keeping you from having too much fun.  Now I will talk about the controls.  If it were for IOS, or ANDROID, I would have let this go, but the ""controls"" barely controlled anything, much less everything.  Personally, I'm not very biased against knock-off F2P games, but it was just too impossible to play without the egregious amount of IAPs, and without a solid controller option.All in all, I'd give this game a 2/10, and would recommend nearly any game over this virtually unplayable game without hackers(and there are plenty of those).1/10(with hackers)",0

16336,"Personally, I didn't enjoy this game. Rather, it was more of a pain to play than fun. When I disassembled the AK-47 and M1911, they were so cool and very introcate. I enjoyed that bit, but then they introduced this EXP system where I had to earn EXP by doing moreâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥with the guns I've already destroyed. Then on top of that, there's literally banners featuring their DLC for this game. At first, I thought I'd give this EXP system a go, but then it instantly backfired on me because the tutorial was forcing me to do ""games"" with said AK-47 where I'd have to COMPLETELY disassemble the ENTIRE weapon as fast as I could with no hints. Must I remind you that this was litearlly no more than 30 minutes of gameplay before they instantly expected me to remember how to completely disassemble the weapon and do it as fast as possible. This was just a nightmare for me because they added in EVEN MORE PARTS TO DISASSEMBLE, WHICH MADE ME EVEN MORE CONFUSED. Oh, and did I mention that the AK-47 is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ to disassemble? If it were with the pistol, I would have been A LOT more comfortable, but no, they just HAD to stick me with the hardest weapon in the game to disassemble.Look, if you're a guns expert and are too poor to buy real games on Steam, then this is the PERFECT game for you. If you're a casual gamer who knows a FEW things about guns, then no, go away, you're going to have a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing brain injury before you're done finishing this game. Maybe it's because I'm impatient, but I'd rather have every single weapon there and already unlocked so that I could just shoot them, disassemble them, play with them on the fly instead of going through their 10 hour long tutorial and having to waste even more time on the exact same weapons that I've already got done with just to unlock more weapons.",0
11652,"Freestyle 2 caters to both casual and hardcore audiences. The game's simple learning curve allows anyone to just jump in and start having fun. As for your main character, you get to choose from 5 positions (Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Small Forward, Power Forward, and Center).There are also 2 Competitive Modes: Team Match which is a 3v3, and Individual Mode is 1v1. Co-op vs AI mode is also available.If you’re a fan of basketball, there’s no reason you shouldn’t be playing this game. It’s generous, it gives you free stuff such as clothes and outfits on an almost daily basis, premium characters for free and an amazingly addictive gameplay experience to top it all off.",1
3449,"Early Access ReviewGreat Battle Royale game - very good sound, decent gun variety, pretty good movement. The ""pack"" feature is my favorite in any battle royale game so far, especially because I myself am a big fan of snowboarding- though it would be cool if you could choose whether you wanted to snowboard OR ski in the skiing pack. The health system is my favorite out of all the battle royale games I've played, and thank tencent for hitmarkers. I like the variety of vehicles in the game and the fact that you don't have to rest the fate of the game on whether you find a vehicle or not- especially if you're the farthest from the safe zone you can possibly be. Like I mentioned earlier, I like being able to heal up to full health with bandages, especially if you take accidental fall damage and don't want to waste a first-aid kit.If I had to point out anything to be worked on in the game, I'd start with switching weapons. I can't tell you how many times I've died because someone saw me and I tried to scroll to my gun or switch a different weapon mid-gunfight without any cover. Sometimes the weapon won't switch or you'll accidentally goto one you don't want. As a side-note- It would be cool to see the climbing pack become more viable to use in game other than just running up really tall things and ziplining. Maybe make more things climbable? or give them spiked boots to be able to run faster over the snow? It would make sense to me.",1
16891,"Early Access ReviewIt will be a good game, right now its very very early access. My problem isn't because its early access. Its because it installs a seperate launcher without it being obvious its being installed. I uninstalled the game on steam, and every time I boot up its back installing updates on start up. That is a very shady practice from Gajin, and I wont stand for it.",0
7735,The game used to be abosuletly amazing. Every day I would come on to collect my star bonus and over a few weeks I would have myself a new character to play and level up. Now the only way to get characters is to pay money. I (as like lots of other players) like to play games that are 100% free and i think that the game has been completely ruined. The game has so much potential if it just makes it possible to buy characters with coins again but keep the option to buy them with the premium currency. The potential is there and can easily be reached.,0
14806,"Early Access ReviewITs hard to get money and its crap,the dev wont to change it back to the old way as they will not make a much money.(They do not care about the community just there pockets!) nothing ealse to say ecept It is a compltetly PAY TO WIN game...The ranking system is crap as I am rank 85 and have no money so i play with the starter gun and play with people with legendery guns/gear. THere simply is no ranking system!!",0
4903,"Pretty good game. It's free. I think the only thing thats worth putting money on is the ultimate god pack because it gives you every single character for free.  makes the game more interesting and less grindy. Typical moba except its more emphasis on the skill base. Balanced better than other mobas imo and is pretty fun. Don't be a toxic player, learn from your mistakes and you're bound to have a good time! The devs are meme lords and push skins in chests that can be obtained through money, which is kind of dumb in my opinion, but if you really care about the game its your money. I haven't encountered any horrible game breaking bugs but I do know that the devs are constantly pushing new content out which is nice in comparison to other games that take forever to release new characters or content. The game does take quite a bit of time to play, however, unless you're beating some cheeks and the enemy team surrenders.  so be ready to spend hours playing 2-4 matches.",1

2571,"2000 Gold Eagles to ducktape shrubs to my tank? Thats the last straw for me and it should be for you guys too! Don't support these money sucking Rusian biases anymore until they change thier ways. Gajin can take my credit card and shove it up thier @$$es.Cation, huge wall of text, but contains the truth. also, I apologise for any spelling errors. Thankyou for your time.My Professional Review:   To make this more professional, I have been playing War Thunder for over 3 years. I have ssen they game grow up and add lots of awsome features like ground forces and lots of game engine additions. They also added a lot of additions that are either poor or money grabbing scemes like the vehicle research and xp conversion system. And they battle rating which is and has been one of the biggest problems with the game. you might not think its a problem at low tiers but wait till you get to tier 4 or 5, then you will be ripping your hair out every match epecially if you are a bomber player. If they would just sit down and fix the BR, the game would be 3x more enjoyable and might even help fix some of the Russain and German bias you probably heard so much about. Last, is the Gajin staff and forum moderators. While I give them credit for some of the great work they have done, they completely disregard the community and thier oppinions which is another reason why this game isn't reaching its full potential. The staff always says that if you have any opinions or ideas to make the game better, to go talk about it on the forums. Most of the time they dont read any of the suggestions most of the time unless a post is attracting a lot of attention. If they don't like what the post has to say, they will take it down and ban the author from the forums because I guess they still don't have freedom of speech in Russia. What really irritates me is thier recent actions to the community like thier "" Russian Bias Party"" joke which while I agree it was kind of funny, was also unproffesional. What really upset me though was thier cash grab with the new tank customization features. After recieving community backlash about charging 500 Golden Eagles for tank customizations and bush camo, which I disagree with at least paying for the bushes. They then stated 2 days later that that was only a special and raised some of the bushes up to 2000 GE. I found this vulgar and unproffesional, Gajin has plenty of money not to do this yet they just keep trying to milk thier money maker of a game. If Gajin wants to keep thier community happy, they need to get thier act together anf if you are still here, welcome to the madhouse and don't pay Gajin a cent until they fix themselfs and the game.",0

16195,"This is by far the best idle game I have ever played. I'm a pretty big idle game fan, so I'm always looking for new ones to play, but this one really took the cake. It's extremely in depth, easy to learn, and goes on for SOOO long. I've always wanted an idle game that kept going for a long time that wasn't repetetive, and this is it. Clicker Heroes probably is longer, but it's basically just the same thing over and over. This game constantly has new thing to unlock, new goals to achieve, and new strategies to learn.I've mostly been playing on mobile, but my save has 72 days on it, which includes offline and online. But I've been playing a lot over those 72 days, and according to the wiki, I'm not even HALFWAY to the end. The game can be really complex at times, and sometimes it may be easier to look up how to do something rather than experiment, but you never really have to. I looked up a lot of things during my playthough of the game, and followed the wiki pretty closely, but if you are more about discovering the right way to do things yourself, then that also works, but may take a bit longer.Overall, this is an amazing idle game, and I'm so glad I decided to pick it up. I really like that there is a mobile version too, as I can transfer my save between platforms if I need to. With so much content, and the fact that it is still being updated, I can picture myself spending a lot of time with this game. This is the idle game I've always wanted.",1
2078,"9/10 - Hello Diablo III! This game is almost what the Diablo III should have been. Except this game is free (not pay2win), evolving and has huge and complex skill tree.

6291,"Early Access ReviewIf you are looking for a free to play world war 2 game this not for you. It is no where near a free to play game especially for new players. I am an ironsight player from other WW2 games all the way up to modern FPS games and the sights for this game are just horrendous. Map layout- The layout for each map are excruciatingly uneven especially with spawn points being steps away from a capture point. Spawn camping is a common occurence with high ranking players going behind the spawn and shooting those who have just spawned. Many maps are so uneven that if you get the good spawn that no matter how bad your team is you will still win.Weapons- Starter weapons are starters they aren't the best but they should still be able to do damage, they kinda don't. Yeah they hit but they don't deal nearly any damage. If you want a new gun even a low tier new gun be ready to empty what little credits you get to get that gun and hope its good(whitch it isn't). If you use a gun or GRENADE too much you have to repair it. Yes you have to repair a GRENADE!!!!!! The expense of repairing a weapon  or GRENADE is about the same price as a new gun. So if you can't afford a new gun, you may not be able to even play the game. Free to Play- Yes you can download it and play a few games for free. But if you run outta credits early on you may have to wait to even play. Or you can shell out money to play. I have played world of tanks, War thunder, and other WW2 FtP games and have never been bombarded so much to buy gold to even get farther into a game. This is no where near a free to play game. Yes this is a beta so maybe it will change but right now it is very much a free but you have to pay to continue farther game.",0

At one moment you'll be raging and wanting to bash someone's head in with your keyboard/joystick. There's a lot of annoying stuff in the game, mostly spammers and  point farmers , but once you get good at the game, you can easily counter that and sweep the floor with 'em.Now, how do I describe this game? I can go for the low-hanging fruit and say it's a Smash clone, but if so, it's a Smash clone done right. See, every character, instead of having their own specific set of moves that noone else has, have two weapons. Now, while the specials of these weapons will differ from character to character, the basic attacks for say, one character with Sword will be the same for the other character using Sword. For the incredibly low and generous price of 'free', I'd say getting the game is worth it. Just be advised, it'll take several hours to learn how to play, so I suggest you spend some time in training and vs Bots after the Tutorial, maybe with a combo guide open, to learn. That is, unless if you're gonna play casually.Pros:+Interesting soundtrack+Easy to learn, hard to master+Overall fun, reallyCons:-Can sometimes be infuriating-Takes a lot of hours to really enter the game if you want to be competitive/win",1
7779,"So... For first, this game is mostly about grinding, experiencing and things like that. If You don't like to grind, this probably isn't game for You. I played this something about 1,300 hours. There are a lot of work, if You want to be good at this game You need to spend on this so much time and I think you should play everyday at least few hours, like in the other MMO-RPG games. Graphics... Graphics are kinda cool, funny and pleasing to the eye. They are mainly square and I think You don't need the greatest computer on the world to play on the optimal fps. In Trove you have 15 classes to play, so You have fun for a lot of time if You want to get them all on at least high level. The largest problem in this game, is I think, server working. Ping on server is sometimes horrible. Sometimes You can not even play, because at least enter the dungeon is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in' impossible because of this. Once, I had over 1500ms for something about hour.But except of this problem, the game is awesome.

As a MOBA its LANES are not filled with AI controlled CREEPS, rather the lanes are controlled by the players. So, the players have the all the control over the game. And as a spaceship game, it has spaceships with proper and detailed ""space"" aesthetics and game mechanic. By the way, the game may feel bit slow at the beginning as the ships seems to move slowly (even jet also seems to move slowly when we see it in relation to sky).

17270,"Having played for a few hours, I'm still not sure how I feel about this game. The greatest issue I am having with it is the loading times just to get in. Once the game was downloaded, it took over half an hour just to gain access, and then another half hour after logging in for the game to actually start. Once in the game, it was fairly straight forward for an MMO. To gain access to the extras, you need to subscribe and it constantly reminds you of this, but you're guided through the games and quests, which are fairly simple. For my kids, the wait times are insanely frustrating. Not too many kids are going to wait around for half an hour or more to play a game before finding something else to do. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is looking for something to do on the fly - chances are, you'll never get in during your free time. But it is entertaining once you actually gain access...",1
12204,"Early Access Review2/10 - Here's an ocean joke instead:""In the shark-infested waters of the Caribbean, two prawns called Justin and Christian are discussing the pressures of being a preyed-upon prawn. “I hate being a prawn,” says Justin. “I wish I were a shark.” Suddenly, a mysterious cod appears. “Your wish is granted,” he says. Instantly, Justin becomes a shark. Horrified, Christian swims away, afraid his former friend might eat him. As time passes, Christian continues to avoid Justin, leaving the shrimp-turned-maneater lonely and frustrated. So when he bumps into the cod again, he begs the mysterious fish to change him back. Lo and behold, Justin is turned back into a prawn. With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes, he swims back to the reef to seek out Christian. As he approaches, he shouts out: “It’s me, Justin, your old friend. I’ve changed… I’ve found Cod. I’m a prawn again, Christian.”",0

The Foundry feature, which allows players to create their own quests for the community's use, has some good quests but this tool has not lived up to its potential.  NWO has an interesting skills system and the wide number of hirelings and mounts improve the game to some degree, but overall the game is disappointing and lacks long term playing potential.",0
5715,"Excellent flight simulator. I have hundreds of hours on this game total, however switched from Steam to the official launcher instead for better beta access and access to many more purchasble aircraft.Some things to note about this simulator are:1) This is a flight simulator, not an arcadey flying game. There are options to make the game easier, but I have not used them so I cannot speak on how it plays with those settings enabled.2) As a flight simulator the learning curve is pretty immense. It takes many many hours to get comfortable flying a specific aircraft and learning each specific thing it has to offer. This isn't even counting the time it takes to get used to the combat aspects.3) The level of detail in the clickable cockpits is quite simply, amazing. Having nearly every switch and system functional is something no other game offers to the extent DCS does.I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging, yet rewarding flight simulator. Would not recommend to anyone looking for games like Ace Combat (Nothing wrong with those games, but it's not a simulator). I would also recommend anyone seriously consider buying this game to invest in a decent flight stick, as you pretty much need it.",1

( kv 220 begin sold by 700, and it was bought...), bear in mind that the market place uses Gaijin Coins..., 1 coin = 1$ usd so every single usd spend on the market place, is one usd into gaijin pocket, so yes, someone tought that buying 700 usd worth of gaijin coins was a good ideaand now testing the waters for some straight pay to win♥♥♥♥♥♥ that at first glance seems not so p2w but it is, just not at an exagerated extent, but this is just a hint of what is posible to come into war thunder, and this will not be the last P2W feature we will seeimo this is not just a problem of gaijin, is a problem of everybody who spend money on this game ""without thinking""is not bad to spend money in the game, the game itself is not free to maintain and the devs deserve to be compensated for their hard work to make us entretained, but wasting 700 us in ONE vehicle without thinking what would be the consecuenses of that actionyeah, if you have 700 usd and you want to buy the tank, i guess is fine, you are free to do so, butif you also want to keep playing the game and not have 5 min or 10 or 20 min queue times, then you may want to think twice what means to buy a 700 usd tankit means that you give the message to gaijin that you are fine buying an OP tank for stupid ammounts of moneyand what gaijin will think about that is they can make a lot profit out off 1 vehicle, wich means they dont need to put effort into the game to improve it, as long as they release more vehicles to make the profit, making new gamemodes and better maps become secondary, i mean, people cant buy maps, and game modes, there is no profit out of that...that also apply for collectors, who buy any vehicle just to have it when they might not even use it, gaijin also takes a lot of profit out of this and thats why collectors are also part of the problemif you take into account the long last behaviour of gaijin of only adding more and more vehicles into the game, but minimal changes to gameplay and mechanics correspond with what im saying herealso researching vehicles with GE contributes more with the problem of grindingthe Comunity gives the message of what they want with their money,  the Comunity decided to buy vehicles for the sake of having them    therefore the Comunity got what they wantedand the consequences about it are: lots of vehicles added, little to none development into the game itself, making the game stall over time, people who cant pay enough money to grind, leave out of frustration, more and more players leave, the MM gets longer and then you have that sweet 20 min queue time i talked about earlythis kind of behaviour can be seen not only in this game, but in the industry, EA is an example, and its loot Boxes controversy is in great part because people buy them in the first place, maybe not so much in Battlefront, but definitively in previous gamesalso with other companies like apple in the phone market to name oneor why a Lamborgini cost millions while the materials and the manufacturing process may cost as much as a crap caror the reason why it exist in the first placein short, if you want to go by the consumist path and buy everything you want because you can without thinking in the consequences, go ahead, but later dont complain about them later",0

6278,"Edit: wil update this review soon when I feel like spending some time on it since I've gotten back into the game recently and some stuff has changed.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: I have also played on browser version, so my total playing time is ways more than just my steam hours.I started playing after the timoshenko update hit and I absolutely loved it. Great gameplay, lots of laughs, premium players have no advantages (except leveling/money bonusses and weapon skins) and the way it worked was good. Reto did a lot to improve the game, they added new guns, nerfed and buffed stuff to make it more fair. The thing i loved about this game was the different weapons for each faction, all with their own characteristics. The grinding part of the game is kinda bad, but when you have grinded long enough you can upgrade your gun. That is also something i loved about this game, since you can mod your guns the way you like them. A big disadvantage about the grinding and modding thing is that people you'll fight against as a beginning player will have better guns, but that is not that bad since its lots of fun to play. It was huge fun to participate in a battle with tanks, planes, and lots of lil' infantry jimmy's. There was still a lot of work to do, since hits werent always counted and character movement was quite poor. Reto improved that and added lots of stuff to the game in the updates. A little bit to much probably. We have loads of camo to choose from now but we only have a few maps to fight in. They keep adding camo and and unnecessary stuff (like the third german pistol), but it seems like they dont care about adding new maps. In one of the last updates they added more vegetation, but all they did was copy paste the same bush all over the place. After 5 years of early access developing, the graphical part of the game is still very bad.Something else i dont like about the game is the toxic community who wants reto to nerf everything they get killed with. Thats also because of the different types of players (e.g. tankers want to nerf anti tank stuff, infantry wants to nerf tanks). I used to play all classes and i think it is pretty balanced. Reto did a good job on balancing, allthough the russians are a little bit underpowered and germans a bit overpowered (e.g. MG42(1200 max rpm) and the heavily armored tanks).Till this ""Devyatayev"" squad update hit i absolutely loved it. Sometimes the battles where a little unbalanced, e.g. when the enemys had lots of tanks and your team had none, but if u had a tanker u could easily switch and kick some♥♥♥♥♥ This is diffirent right now. You have to grind your squad ribbon to be able to switch to diffirent classes. I have quit a lot of characters, I need to grind em all up to be able to play normally again. Another thing about this squad system is that you can never play alone, you will always be in a squad with some random guys who are f*cking around.They have done such a thing with the ribbon system in an earlier update, when they went through the ribbon system, but it wasnt that bad, since u could still use all of your characters. At that time, there were not that much experienced players with lots of characters, so it didnt matter that much. Right now, there are lots of player who have grinded their way up and have lots of characters. They will all have to grind that ribbon on their characters to be able to play normally again. With this being said, i dont recommend this game to new players, since it is still in early acces and things like this will probably happen some more in the future. It will also take a long time before it can be released, because there is still a lot of work to do, especially the amount of maps(maps are all same scenery) and graphical part of the game is very poor. For someone who just starts, this new squad (ribbon) system wont be the problem, you'll just level ur squad ribbon up through playing while ur grinding for better equipment. But still, something like this might happen again in the future, so you'll be just as mad on reto as a big part of the community right now.If Reto dont chance this squad system and refuse to add new maps and if they dont improve the graphical part of the game im gonna leave and play some battalion 1944 or Red orchestra, or even WW1 (Verdun, Battlefield 1) instead. I always liked Heroes and generals more than other ww2 games like battalion and red orchestra just because of the tank, plane and infantry gameplay all together and of course because of the generals part of the game. If not this is after Warthunder the second Free2play WW2 game im gonna quit because the developers are f*cking it up.",0
14569,"Early Access ReviewAs of late this game has become cancerous, horrible, terrible, absolutely crap. Ill be talking about some major points.1: Weapons2: Types of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bots3: Rewards after each match4: The matching system5: Removed tech tree6: Pilot Seat Removed1: WeaponsThere are 3 major weapons I want to talk about. A: The worst one of them all, the Rocket Launcher B: Anti-air C: Shotguns.A: Rocket launchers are the worst, they are also the most expensive. To use them you lock onto a target and fire away, one volley should more or less kill anything, if not kill it, incapacitate it or heavily damage it unless target does evasive movements, which is just spamming all your movement buttons trying to get to cover. One rocket does 40700 damage, and you fire roughly 12 per volley. It can be placed on anything, tanks, mechs, crawlers and even helicopters, worst thing about them being on helis is that you cant get to cover because they just fly above you and they are hard to hit unless you have anti-air. Basically, these guns require no skill what so ever to use, they seem like a lot but in hind sight, they are very very easy to get, a few days of playing, maybe a week of saving up and you can get one.B: Anti-Air guns, Flak cannons. THey are absolute cancer when it comes to ANYTHING that flies or hovers. They detonate when they come close to a flying thing, you don't even have to be flying, just in the air, so this counts for Mechs who jump or Crawlers who jump too. They cost the LEAST and have the same explosive radius as the strongest Plasma Cannons, which is horse crap. They do 31710 damage each shot but cripple any fliers there are. Some people have both this and a rocket launcher on their ship making it the worst thing in existance to planes and helis.C: Shotguns. THese things arent too bad, they do jack all if you are any further than about 50 yards. They can only be shot 4 times before all your energy is drained and you gotta wait but normally if you get close enough, thats enough to kill anything. THey do the most damage with a shocking 225000 per hit, but that drops durastically as the range increases. They are strong too, with 110618 health, they can take quite a beating.2: Bots. There are several kinds of bots that are just horrible to fight against. A: Mechs B: Box Fliers C: Helis with rockets A: Mechs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. THey have the most health they already come with shields on their legs, they can jump and are relitively fast. The most common mech is one with shotguns or any other god/cancer gun supported by normally the strongest smgs or plasma cannons in the game. These bots are able to take on any other bot and win pretty much, they jump aroudn and get close to you before using their shotgun to wipe the floor with you, or they use their other cancer guns on you. You can kill them if you have a buddy or if you can manage to take out the mechs guns or legs. You can have LITTERALLY everything at the front in one place, gravity doesnt exist for them, it can be as high as the effiel ♥♥♥♥ing tower and have two piddly little legs and it wouldnt matter, it would walk fine, jump fine, fight fine. If you put Pilots Seats back, it would make Mechs a lot harder to build and use.B: Box fliers. These things are the absolute worst. They dont have wings or heli blades, just thrusters, the way that they are built means its hard to actually kill them or deal sufficiant damage in big doses unless you are right up close to them or you have a shotgun. They do require a sliver of skill to fly and handle but even then it doesnt matter, spend a couple match and you will be flying it well.C: Helis with Rockets. These things are the absolute worst, unless you ahve a rocket or anti-air on your team, you are screwed, this thing is able to fly just to the end of your render distance and fire rockets at you, its hard to get cover as they can just fly over it, normally supported by Plasma Cannons or sometimes SMGs, these things are horrible to deal with.3: Rewards. Ok so, the rewards are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, its chance. You could do the best in the team but get the worst rewards due to luck, you get items now which is annoying kind of, anyone can get anything, a new player could get a shotgun or a rocket lancher. But if you get it, yaaay. You dont get enough money from rewards though, normally. I prefered it when it was money you got from rewards, made it so much better.4: Matching system. They have always had issues with this, if you have a bot with 1000 Pflops, you get put in a game with people that have 1000 Pflops, but some people have no soul and are probably bullies irl or have some sort of issue as they go into those matchs with small ships with rediculously op guns and armour.5: Tech tree was removed, bad move, now anyone can buy the really strong guns if they save up enough. A new player could buy the second strongest Plasma Cannon with ease, same with the SMG. Then refere to the Matching System above6: Pilot Seat Removed: Naah mate, thats silly, having the pilot seat was good because it made people armour up around the seat the most, it made people actually think about how best to make the craft to protect the pilot AND give it the best fire power possible AND it gave people the ability to think about where to shoot the bot, where you thinking the seat is to kill them most efficiently, the only bad thing was you could get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t one shot.Some people are complaining about the fact that you can have 5 different types of guns on your ship, i agree in some ways but at the same time i think it was needed, sometimes a guy with only plasma cannons cant defend himself against a flier. If a Plasma Cannon user came up against an SMG user, he'd pretty much lose in most scenarios because he'd have his guns shot off, the SMGs could get shot off too but you normally run out of energy before you can do that, but if you have at least some smgs you can put up a slightly better fight. I think maybe reduce it to 3 and have cancer/god guns take up all three of thoseSummary: Anything that flies is NEXT TO ♥♥♥♥ING USELESS! Rockets need to be removed or nerfed a bunch, Flak need to cost more and have a reduced explosion size, shotguns, meh, their fine, Box fliers need to be stopped somehow as they are over powered. Mechs need a nerf too. If you use a cancer/god gun you should be put into matchs with other people who have the same god guns. The Matching system needs to be fixed and the reward system needs to be fixed aswell.",0

No other software would be able to provide you more realism and get you closer to what a fighter pilot really feels aboard those powerful machines. The numerous controls are hard to handle at first and I recommend you to read the flight manuals to familiarize yourself with the numerous instruments available to you. The tutorials are too basic and don't allow you to put in practice what you've just learned as they are just a bunch of videos. So the flight manuals are really not a luxury you should pass. Dont worry they are free but It would take some hours to read it all as it's pretty consistent.On a personal note I'm not pushing for gender equality but if you could add a female voice for the pilot I would gladly appreciate that. ;) ",1
47,"Early Access ReviewSpooky's House of Jump Scares is worth your time. Being free (as of this review), this is the only benchmark the game has to pass. If it's worth your money, and worth your time, you should play it. While I have very little experience in the horror genre, Spooky's House of Jump Scares is pretty transparent with its premise. There's plenty of cute and lighthearted moments, some jump scares, and a thin thread of plot which goes deeper than the surface level. There are 1000 rooms, so you'll spend most of your time wandering from room to room, taking less than a second to move through one of the many repeated corridors. And, while the enemies are spaced out well enough to keep you interested, they can sometimes be a bit underwhelming. However, there are a couple of genuinely scary moments, and the game has enough charm that you may want to stick around to see it all.If you're looking for simple jump scares this game has you covered, and if you're interested in some horror game mechanics in a boiled-down scenario, check it out.",1

(Doesn't have any impact on playing the game, just makes the classes more difficult to get.)GRINDING - this game is a grind fest at higher levels.Gets a bit boring after a long time playing one class. Although when you find a class which suits you, you're good for a long time. :)NO pvp. (At least for now)Steep learning curve for new players.----- Some comments and tips: -----Max level for a class is lvl 20. Although your level increases as you obtain shadow level gear.Currently I have 4 max level classes: Neon Ninja, Candy Barbarian (sounds silly but it's strong), Dracolyte and Knight. My mastery rank: 87----- If you need any help about the game feel free to add me ingame: Zarlath -----There is also a plenty of community guides which can help you with pretty much anything.The graphics might look silly and dumb for many people, but remember that it's the gameplay that matters the most. :) If you have spare time i'd recommend investing it in this game.10/10 for now.",1
7198,An evolution of the concept from MTG and Hearthstone. No grinding no overzealous microtransaction BS  huge amount of cards is gained for free just by playing. Definitly the best TCG based on popular franchise. Cons are weak and unispirative card design and artwork to some extent but game is released recently.,1
8762,Early Access ReviewLoved the game. The game is still okay. Although if they keep in the direction they are going then I'll probably drop it.The latest patch was a huge step backwards towards every other battle royal game. They took out the crafting of legendary weapons which is in every promo video on this page. Terrible decision. If you wanted to make them harder increase the difficultly in other ways. Do something else like one of these:Create legendary forges you have to use to get the weapons. Make it cost multiple golden chickens to craft the weapon. Make it cost more shardsMake it time based or based on the number of players left when you can create a legendary weapon. Also I hate that you can get legendary weapons from chests. It takes the system before that was semi based on skill and turns it into just another battle royale RNG fest.Also not a huge fan of the hit scan weapons. Doesn't feel very fantasy and increase the chances of dying to someone without any counter play.  ,0
11912,"Early Access ReviewGive it a few months and then take another look. Seriously.- DX9 optimisation is absolutely terrible. Fine for some, very bad for me. It sits on one CPU core and 8-10gb of memory while under-utilising GPU.- Default config is a joke. You may need to tweak config files to make the game playable.- Early access LUL- Terrible translations, incomplete (and apparently inaccurate) tooltips abound.- No severe P2W but there is purchasable convenience including exp boosts and pet related stuff, which can affect gameplay speed.- Premium membership fee is high but it doesn't seem required at all.- Game is fun which is a shame since I kind of wish I could remorselessly refund.EDIT: But wait, there's more! I wasn't aware of the full extent of these before.- Early early access (28th) may have been an anti-refund tactic as it's classed as a DLC.- The game has released in three regions prior (KR, JP, RUS) where it has largely failed.- Significant content, including the entire endgame, was supposed to be present but cut.- The devs have very few excuses for the terrible localisation considering timescales and promises.- The company are wildly making 'balance' changes which show they have no clue how the game operates.- No, really. They nerfed everyone's damage damage by 70% in addition to buffing the healer class again. Paladins are unkillable & break pvp for now.- A deeper look into the skill trees shows very little intelligent design.- Combo system is fun, BUT it looks like a significant limit options, skill and variation.-Premium currency (lumena) for a lot of advantages. Most won't use these but whales will be able to buy progress to a significant degree.- Communist auction house. Prices are set, comrade. No room for capitalist dogs in this video game economy.- Everyone has the same gear because there isn't any variation. Item drops come from a VERY short list.- Premium membership exists to reduce in-game costs that are artificially present. Not having it will hurt your cash flow.All in all, total trainwreck. I wanted to like it, truly - it has some charming features like its aesthetic and the combat is fun for a while. I simply can't support the devs in what they've been doing here.",0

It is just your age and recent memory... Does it lack in some aspects??? Sure it does... Does it have more in others??? Yes...

9044,"I decided to change one of the most liked and oldest reviews of this game - https://imgur.com/a/QeSJ1epEven i'm one of the biggest promoters of this game in Poland I decided to change my review to negative.13.12.2018 Daybreak announced Planetside Arena, whole new game in battleroyale mode and few other modes like capture the flag in close combat PS style. It's not going to happen and not going to be success. Biggest fans joined the livestream nad everyone was outraged, against this Arena idea.Daybreak lost my respect few years ago for closing very cool games, milking them first - Everquest Next closed, H1Z1 idea closed and BR H1Z1 is dying, Daybreak closed. Later Daybreak lost my respect again, They were streaming and show that they don't even know what was in Planetside 1. At some point on the broadcast, the developers got stuck because they did not know what was in the first Planetside when already, talking about it. Chat on livestream exploded with hatred.Now instead of speeding up the big changes in Planetside 2 that bring in more players, they decided to work on something that has become an object of hate for thousands of fans. We were so hyped about getting a new continent, we were hyped to get a new NS fraction, we were hyped to get support for the new DX. A great chance to bring thousands of new players to the game. For what? It's better to ruin reputation with another battleroyal. DAMN DAYBREAK. Why are you so stupid? I know why, because you don't know know how to make games.  Adding a new continent, a new faction, and letting the game to work well on not-high-end computers in large battles is a great option, ruined by the tragic idea of â€‹â€‹Battleroyale. Unfortunately, as I have recommended Planetside 2 to everyone so far, I am not doing it anymore.",0

17404,"*sigh* School of Dragons had potential, but failed poorly in execution. The gameplay feels clunky, the quests (which is SUPPOSED to be the main part of any MMORPG) feels empty, unrewarding and mainly consists of fetch-quests. Except from a few minigames, which are rather boring already, there isn't really any content for the game. Unless you are willing to become a member. But even then, you only get new dragons to ride on(which, may sound cool, it's done in a very, very awkward way.) and some new cosmetics. Then nothing else. NOTHING at all. You can finish all the quests in like a week's time(granted, I finished it in like 3 days back when it is still only on their website via Unity Web Player, with all the guide arrows last year, but still they are on by default...) and then you got nothing to do. Riding and raising your own dragons is a cool thing...but they set up payment barriers for F2Ps so that they need to pay in order to get more dragons, which, I'm doubting they would, seeing that they game does not actually have enough content to keep them there.(Or, they could potentially just start a new account to experience it again....I did. And I admit I was dumb.)But by far, the most disappointing thing about this game, is not how the graphic is terrible, comparing to what Unity could actually do(I feel like that the reason for the horrid graphics is to make sure that a lot more pcs can run it and to maintain the same experience for all players across and probably add in that their servers might not be able to handle massive data flow or something like that, I don't know. It's just speculation. As a sidenote though, AT LEAST LET THE PLAYERS CHOOSE THE RESOULTION OF THE GAME THAT THEY WANT TO PLAY ON), it's the aim of the game and demographic players for the game.I'm a fan of the How To Train Your Dragons series for a while now, and what I've seen from the online fandom, is that they are mostly consist of people who are teens and even young adults, instead of what the game is targeting at, which is like for 6-10 year-olds. So there's a lot of quests in the game that attempts to teach the players about real-world science that they are supposed to be learning at school, and the entire game felt like it was too dumbed down to cater for them. First of all, the science quests. They. Ruin. Immersion. NO one wants to learn science in a world where glass is a valuable and people wear horned helmets to protect themselves in the constant battles and dragons are real. In fact, I'm pretty sure that during the Viking age, most of what we learned about since today hasn't even been theorized or ever touched on! I would rather just focus on training dragons and fly with them, thank you very much.I remember like the original aim was to like 'train, raise your own dragon and learn real world science along the way' or something like that, That's just something I can't agree on.And then there's the catering problem. I know, How To Train Your Dragon is supposed to be a children's film, but it feels mature(especially in the sequel, I don't want to spoil it so go find yourself and cry forever. A major character's parent died.), that's probably why it gathered a number of older fans, but even then, the game developers ignored the needs of them and would rather create something to milk money for themselves. Shame on you.If you are a fan of the Dragons franchise, you could go try out the game...on your own behalves. This game is just not worth it. As for anyone else, nope. Don't even get the idea to click that button to install. It's not worth your time.",0
4216,"Pretty decent game, for a FTP model. People may say its P2W, sure but nearly all card games are to begin with anyway even building real life meta decks costs you 100's of dollars to make.

Gameplay is more simpler than the other yugioh titles because the maximum number of cards is 30 and minimum is 20 in a deck, i quite like this feature because it allows you to consistently get the draws you need to win your games.

I loved the way you could make aircraft like you want with the manoeuvrability you want, but now whatever you do it's the same mechanic for every aircraft and it's so limited ! you can't roll over or anything it's just up and down a bit now ! WOW ! So boring ! Then the weapons got simplified too, now everything is pretty much the same with a different color and animation ! I really liked the old plasma guns, it was a burst weapon, shoot everything then wait 5 sec to reload ! Now everything is like the rifle: just aim and hold fire button to attack ! Then there is the matchmaking. Before, it was splitted by tier, not perfect but did the job. Now i don't know but you can be a small robot with low values pieces and you get matched like anything else, against powerfull robot that have everything unlocked ! Really unbalanced, plus now you can pay to win ! WOW !Conclusion : this game was something great with a construction that mattered and an interesting gameplay full of possibilities...

However,  finding the materials you need to upgrade tools and stuff is a nightmare and there is true mechanic of where to find certain ores.

And half the time when I am mining, I an ore I really have no interest in is in my way, and have to use an extractor just to continue on or mine around it.

7911,"Hearing stories of Dungeons & Dragons seemed epic and I loved the concept. I've never played the card game with anyone, and when I stumbled upon this game, I was quiet amazed.I have experienced many MMO's, from WoW to a million of other titles - but I've never really engaged in them since all of them seemed similar to WoW. All of them were reflections of what WoW became and it seemed pointless playing other MMO's. This is a whole other story.The character creation stage of the game didn't amaze me, although reading backround stories about each race was quite nice. Choosing the back story of your now-ready adventure is also unique allowing you to rolepay and ""bond"" with your fighter as weird as that sounds. With these sort of games it's hard to see the things that ""make you stay"" from the very beginning, but the main reason behind all the hours that I put into the game is because of the combat system. You don't have a million spells compressed into hotkeys that make you smash your keyboard at any important battle. Here, you have a limited amount of tabs of spells available at one time. It's easy to handle, and easy to get a hold of. Having such limited access to a wild root of spells, prepares you to make serious choices - but also allows you to develop your own way of battle with a few classes, which is quiet special and makes the game more enjoyable. You might have a friend that is a Priest, like you, but he might be a ""engaging in battle"" priest (obvs not a tank) whereas you may be a support priest healing him. Having a group of friends that are all of a different class is obviously the best resolution, allowing you to see how all the classes engage in battle and how all the classes can work together to reach the same goal. The opportunities are endless and with no time limit on how long you have to spend playing, you can be deciding your own way of fighting technique - in your own very way for some time. That is the main reason I stayed and I'm not vouching for anybody else. The game is more enjoyable (not better by any means) when playing with your friends. Dwelling in deep, dangerous dungeons with a group of close companions sounds like a dream and if that's what you're looking for in a game, then Neverwinter should be your choice. There is a large number of dungeons from an early level with them getting more advanced as you advance. The monsters get tougher and more bigger with each new dungeons available. Each dungeon ends with a final, gigantic boss which you SHOULD find challenging. They range from demented souls to... dragons.But yeah, that's just a small ounce of the game. If you're trying to find out more about the game, the best advice I can give is to actually play the game because streams and recorded videos cannot capture the full essence of the game.By no means am I an expert in this game, but I hope that this helped the newcomers that are trying to get in the game.",1
8608,Early Access ReviewNice twist on the BR genre. Really well polished and has some great twists on the gameplay of PUBG and Fortnite.This is gonna be a really popular game. Give it a try. It's free.,1
9395,"Simple yet magical, this game is pure evidence that small games are sometimes the best. How do I know you might ask, well (your name) have you ever imagined a world where you can choose to be a ninja/rogue/wizard etc. yet kill a god? This game reveals that world to you one peace at a time as you slowly unlock new characters by slicing or exploding your enemies. In the end we can all agree that Realm of the mad god is never to be called a bad game (if someone does please torture them until they confess their crimes).",1
14543,"Early Access ReviewWelcome to the game that only gets worse!!!This is a brilliant game if you love developers that only make the game system become more pay to win with each progressive update.

I wish such a time could exist again.Good Job developers, you're idiots.",0

8217,"The game is actually good. I spent more than 4000 hours on it since its release. However, Neverwinter is not only p2w but also operated by a chinese company, which is really awful. This game may be free to play but in fact, it is by far more expensive than any other game in the market. You absolutely cannot get BIS without money or exploits. I played since beta, spent a decent amount of money, and I am still far from being BIS. At the current state, I will never reach BIS because I can't generate enough in-game currency by legal means. The game is also extremely grindy. You have to grind forever make even the smallest changes to your character which makes it really hard for new players to actually become competitive. By the way, if you decide to pay to win through the in-game store, be aware that it may cost thousands of dollars to get decent.The company behind the game is also infamous for its bait-n-switch practices. They promise things on the forums, then break their promises a couple of months later without any consideration for their player base. Please understand this. You do not have active GM's online, bugs rarely get fixed, and there is no transparency in how the devs do business. One of the game's main feature which is the ""Foundry"" gets disabled all the time, and it is currently unavailable to players. It has been down for nearly two months and devs do not even bother to explain why or when they plan to get it back on. In other words, bad customer service, bad dev team, bad business model, and lazy and rushed content,Players have absolutely no voice and censorship is extremely common in the forums. I have posted many times in response to the issues that negatively affect the game just to get my posts removed. The forum moderators lack preparation and it is not uncommon for some staff members to indirectly insult and mock players in response to their lack of satisfaction with the game. I loved Neverwinter since its pre-release. It is a game full of potential with amazing mechanics and possiblities of infinite content through the Foundry. I still play the game but I do not advise anyone to spend money in it. The money you spend is a waste as the economy is volatile and extremely unstable. If you are looking for a game to play for a while that will be fun and rewarding, then NW is not for you. However, if you are looking to just waste time playing a D&D themed game, then go ahead.Update: October 2017. The game is still p2w. Harder to obtain currency. Leadership profession nerfed to the ground. Refinement system is miserable, and the campaigns are WAY MORE grindy than they used to be.Update: June 2018. Cryptic has now nerfed the AD refinement system and the amount of currency one can obtain daily. Another major blow to players in order to stimulate more ZEN purchases. As usual, devs are hurting their player base through questionable business practices.",0

7729,Been a while since I played but when I heard that the game was no longer being fair to layers who don't want to spnd money it all fell apart. All I can say is that Pay2Win business models are always a bad idea and it sucks that this game has gone this way. Once I would have said to buy some stuff because of how well they where handling the microtransaction system and give them a fair shake but now that they've gone full Ebenezer Scrooge I have to say that you shouldn't give them a single cent. If they where to fix their business model I would say it's worth going back but as it is now I cannot just let them trample all over the players that helped them get so far.,0
7268,"I have put hundreds of hours into this game well before it ever hit Steam and boy let me tell you, it was worth every minute!If you are a former HS player then TES Legends will feel familiar while introducing some seriously interesting new and strategic differences. The music ( in my opinion ) is great and doesn't get old, the card art is outstanding! And the game employs some seriously interesting and dynamic field/game mechanics that you should definitely come across in it's Arena modes or the games monthly ""Chaos Arena"". The game is also quite generous with awarding free content for playing especially during the early stages. And with the recently introduced ""Twitch Drops"" you can either get a free Legendary, 600 gold ( which means up to 6 packs with 6 cards per pack ) or 1500 Soul Gems which you use to craft new cards. All just for tuning into ANY stream that is streaming TES Legends! So if you like CCG's should you give this game a shot ? A big hell yes!  ",1
8198,"This game has become more P2W as the game has gone on. That said, the only real P2W area is PvP.  PvE has a much more lax gear requirement to be competetive, though gear does help.The combat system is literally the best in any MMO out there (though some classes have some PvP balance issues, even still).

4547,"What is a MOBA?Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas, or MOBAs for short, originated as a sub-genre of the RTS (Real-Time Strategy) genre. Because of this, in most MOBA games, the player takes control of a single character from the isometric (top-down) view akin to most RTS games. Typically, in MOBA games, a player takes control of a single character on one of two teams. Those players choose characters that all have their own abilities, or “kits”. To win, the players must use a combination of abilities, teamwork, and strategy to not only best their opponent, but destroy the opponents main structures. A bonus to the genre is that most MOBAs are free games, which is definitely a contributing factor of the their massive success. The genre has many titles, the largest of which being Defense of the Ancients (DoTA) and DoTA 2, League of Legends (LoL), and most recently SMITE!What is SMITE?SMITE is one of the more recent free MOBA games to enter the fray. In SMITE you don’t just choose a character, you choose a god. You’ll instantly feel an attachment to characters like Thor and Zeus because even if you don’t know the lore behind them, you’ve at least heard their names before! What makes SMITE so immersive is Hi-Rez Studios’ inclusion of historical lore into the gods’ abilities, kits, and play styles. Thor and Loki aren’t just characters from Marvel comics and movies. They’re also a part of Norse mythology and you can take control of them in SMITE!What makes SMITE different?SMITE takes all of the strategy of the top MOBA games and adds another layer of difficulty by putting you into the action! Unlike most MOBA games, SMITE offers players the chance to experience the MOBA genre they know and love from a third-person perspective. This unique perspective allows for an extremely immersive experience unlike any other game in the genre. While this doesn’t sound like such a big change, once you play it you’ll understand! All of these things added together is what has gaming websites everywhere continually rating SMITE as one of the best MOBA games available!",1

The weapons feel heavy and sound chunky which I love.I usually play the TDM mode, which has an instant respawn. Its the first team to 150 kills. Super laid back. Good way to practice your shooting skills.The other game modes are fun too. Haven't run into any toxic players either which is nice. **My negatives are the fact you have to buy grenades to add to your inventory everyday, which.. yes is trivial but silly.**The homescreen interface can be a bit confusing for new players..

1087,Early Access ReviewOk so I saw this game for fee on the store for the weekend so got it under the asumption of well cost me nothing so worth a try. I am recomending this game however there are some bad points which I am going to get out of the way first. When first loaded I did have some major bugs one crashed my pc completely and another was if I tabed out I could not get back on without restarting the game both seem to have fixed on their own. Another problem is limited content and microtransactions the bane of a gamers existance however its mostly to speed up getting ships or getting skins and there is more content on the way hopefully a few more maps as well as a new gamemode. I have just played over 10 hours in the last two days some with a friend some alone and have now come to the end of the exitement phase and the next ships I want are hours of gameplay or real money away so will not be playing all the time next week but will pop on for a match or so as it is very fun.Now onto the good stuff..The combat is simple and entuative but rewarding flying a massive capital ship into battle is awsome.The ships are amazing they look good and they do play differently so you can play a variety of roles as well as the starter ships being competative so you can get on fine from you first game.Playing with a friend you can comunicate with makes you far more combat effective and more enjoyable would be nice to have the option of being a team of 5 but that may be unfair.Finally the value if you can get it on the free weekend Just do its free fun if not its not overly expensive and it works not like half the alpha junk you find on here begging for full price for nothing. Suffers from a few alpha problems but fun and plays well.Have fun guys.,1

2684,"This is my 1.37 review.http://i.gyazo.com/cc8c867e167736659a21271ae1160e5f.pngThis is the 1.39 review.http://i.gyazo.com/5b835eaacc8e4ac4d9a5eebd0429d5d9.pngThis is the patch 1.41 review. I've spent enough time to get an idea of the new additions and new mechanics that were introduced with this patch and I'll highlight them below. First thing to note is that Patch 1.41 is not as big of a patch as 1.37 and 1.39 were. In fact it was released under a month that 1.39 was out. I'll highlight the changes below.The biggest addition of patch 1.41 was the introduction of Ground Forces into the open beta phase for everybody. While this had a lot of hype built up and player numbers rose even breaking 100k the beta only introduced two countries, Germany and Russia. These countries don't even have fully fleshed out trees which I can understand but it makes me wonder when the other nations will get their Tank trees AND have them fully fleshed out. The gameplay of Tanks is rather interesting. You have a tank, you play on different sections of familar maps given the task of eliminating other tanks, capturing objectives or defending points. Tanks is excellent with the detail that Gaijin have placed into the game. Like planes every part of a tank reacts differently to how it will perform when hit. Your ammo can cook off or your tracks can get off. You do get the option to repair mid battle which is risky but useful. Something that is annoying however is the constant artillrry spam that all players do. Some realism aspects like armor thickness and certain shells not being able to penetrate is a great addition but doesn't bode well in the term of balance. Some reserve tanks are not competitive against even Tier 2 tanks as their shells can not pierce the armour. This is ignoring some tanks which are just unspeakably broken (KV-1).For the planes we had a few additions. Germany received two new Me-262 Jets, one placed on the way to the German Sabre, and other with a 50mm cannon placed in a separate destroyer line (the Me410 with the 50mm cannons). The British received more Spitfires bringing their total in the entire tech tree to 13. The Americans received two B25 variants, one with a 75mm cannon and the other with an impressive 12 .50 cal mg's. The Russians get a Mig with cannons with a BR that guarantees low tier clubbing and the crazy brother of the I-185. The M71 Etalon.The Japanese received a cockpit for the Ki45 line. (yes, just cockpits).These aren't the only changes, there were a massive amount of BR changes and these truly go to show how much Gaijin don't pay attention. Russian and American BR's went down while Germany and Japan skyrocketed. The high tier Japanese props have a higher BR than the Yak 15 and Yak 17 Jet. Granted those Jets are awful but that doesn't fare well for the fractured Japanese community. The Me-163 jumped back up into Mig and Sabre games after the amount of crying on the forums may have deafened Gaijin while the Mig 15 and Bis for Russia went down, the cannon Sabre went down whilst the German variants remain at 8.7. The msot controversial change was the P63 going from a 5.3 to a 4.0 Seal clubbing has never been so obvious. It leads to games all over the place. There is no balance, just pilot skill used to base the BR's which is a terrible decision as countries with large player bases have lots of data whilst countries with smaller playerbases have less data. It is why Japan are soaring high. Tier 2 A6M2 against Tier 4 La7 and P51? Clearly working as intended.It's hard to give an honest opinion about what I think about this patch. Some areas could really do with a fix. Japan could do with more content. The BR system needs to be on PLANE PERFORMANCE and not player performance to ensure more balance and the Tank mechanics really give more tuning. I'll recommend the game for the addition of Ground Forces but I will not recommend Patch 1.41.",1

4502,"now first i wanna say this is probably my favorite multiplayer game of all time, i'm a casual player and this game gets my adrenaline pumping and when i say i ove this game, i mean that i love this game, if it was a woman, well you know, i don't, i don't have woman, also i've been playing since beta, and having 60 hours over the span of 4 years isn't much, but i have seen the evolution of the UI, stage designs, playerbase, ETC.first, yes a new player to this game is going to be absolutely ripped to shreds, there is so much to learn, there are so many gods, so many items, so many tryhards, i can imagine it feeling like a job to learn everything to be somewhat decent, this is a problem, and a lot of new players will just feel like they are being slapped around like a small child by people that played this game a little longer.Gods -There are many of them, and variety is good, a lot of the gods have different abilities and different roles because of that, a lot of tactics are avalible and a lot of gameplay styles. i will say that the gods are kindof expensive, i've played 60 hours and i've only unlocked a little over 1/3 of the roster. being completely free to play and all that.Competetive -With any competetive moba's there are competetive jerkoffs, it's the single reason i back away from this game on many occasions, people telling me what to do and people scolding at me, giving me no constructive criticism, i'm a casual player, i don't care if i win or lose as long as i have a nice intense match of smite, but there are many game modes that are much less competetive, conquest is the most dangerous in my opinionDiffeculty Curve -Wowee, i only bring this up because i was trying to get a friend into this game, and he is a picky bastard but he was totally overwelmed, even with me telling him what he can pick, and telling him he should take his time on what to pick, he still got pretty shafted, learning gods and what they can do is a big thing in any moba, but with so many gods, it gets hard to keep track of, luckely there are a lot of general favorites so you can block out some of these gods from learning since they suck (ratatoskr)Point is, it take a while to get used to, i would recommend it to you should you want to take the time and learn slowely but surely ( i would advise assault arena to learn how to play with and against various gods), but for me, this game is a lot of fun, action packed, tactical, teamwork, funny game. Also recently they added all kinds of random events, one of them being kart racing, and it was almost really really good, so it's worth checking it out for that, this game is beyond just a moba. ",1
1713,"Probably the most cancerous and toxic game anyone could possibly decide to spend time playing.Chances are that someone in a match will try to ruin the fun for everyone else.But what I love about this game is that from the second of reaching the hero selection screen, everyone's choices will affect the outcome of the match. No fake railroad good or bad ""decisions"" - everything you decide to spend your time on impacts the game either positively or negatively.It's a very complex game and there's a steep learning curve. The game is very teamplay oriented, hence why people get upset if they feel their teammates aren't performing to the best of their ability.Mainly what the game comes down to is who makes the first mistake, and if the other team is able to take advantage of it to create more opportunities and eventually take the enemy's ancient.It's a fun learning experience, as long as one doesn't let the occasional whining or hateful comments get to them.",1

2141,"I plan to write more reviews, but they will be short enough for all to read but just enough infoA 100% free to play game that has more depth, more content, and much to do than most games you would shell out money for. It's like Diablo 3 but darker and a more grittier feel. Story- You are exiled and left in a continent or place called Wraeclast. You venture out in dungeons, caves, ruins, jungle, and other locale in Wraeclast.Gameplay- You select various classes: Maurauder (melee/tank), Duelist (Hybrid of melee/range), Ranger (Archer), Witch (Mage), Templar (Hybrid), and a Scion (unlock after 1st act). So there is a character for just about any play-style. Destroy the many hordes of creatures in Wraeclast to gain experience and level up. You get nice loot based on the enemies you kill or quests you complete. You get to use special colored components to enhance your weapons and gear. And PoE boasts a massive skill tree that I have ever seen in games. The skill tree is like an extension to the colored components, but you can specifically add points to certain attributes. Online/Co-op- There is some co-op play, but keep in mind you have to be close in level with other players. There are guilds to join. You can trade some of your gear with other players. There's also PvP, and often times tournaments you can qualify for to make the game challenging. Cons- Minor gripe is for some not so good netcoding. You think your character is at one point on a level, but a split millisecond, his/her position was somewhere else, as if he teleported. It can get confusing, sometimes frustrating when dealing with a mob of enemies. But it's a minor gripe.Conclusion: If you like Diablo games, give this a try. Game has a bit of a learning curve to it, but there are plenty of guides, and helpful people that can get you started or keep you moving on. There's plenty to do. The game today is completely different from when it was first available. Most importantly, the game is FREE!! The only time money would be spent is for purely cosmetic enhancements to your character. This was the first game I ever put over 100 hours into on Steam, and it was worth it.",1

Dont get me wrong this is one excelent game with a fatal flaw that cant be overlooked(but could be easily fixed). Match making! My god the irony of that word in this game (its funny when you wait for game to start there is a message saying ""wait untill you are matched fairly"":D). Basicly when i was lvl 30 i was and still am constantly matched with ppl using lvl76 weapons (meaning the are at leest 2.5 times my lvl!) and that was not just one-two gamse with one-two ppl, no its more that half of ppl every game. It kills all the joy of lvling coz whats the poing of geting a new weapon when  you know its already underpowerd compered to standard weapons used.

They throw TONS of boosters your way, but rares and legendaries are very strong, hard to come by and good decks contain many of them. The latest set is almost 40% more expensive than the others because of a drastic spike in legendaries.2. lack of decisionsOnce you know the rules and the unintuitive special cases you are a robot playing your deck. It mostly (but not exclusively of course) comes down to luck. Contrary to what is said over and over, there are very few decision points in the game. Especially in the beginning you are usually VERY limited. Your deck, draw and matchup matter most.3. power systemThe power system is flawed and frustrating. It makes me anxious. It's also a reason why decisions are extremely limited.",0

Whenever I'm not playing something like Dota or any other assortment of indie games in my inventory, this is essentially ran in the background - on Steam or otherwise.My only real qualm with this version is that purchasing rubies is still not fully implemented, so you can't use Steam funds yet in this game to get rubies. To be fair, this only affects those already with funds and want to spend that, but if you just want to buy straight-up, just export to Kongregate and buy them there, then send it back - heck you could set up the cloud during this and get a free achievement.If you're a fan of idle games, definitely give this a try.",1

3559,"Early Access ReviewThis game is fun and i'm having more of a fun time playing than PubG for sure. Something that gets on my nerves thoug (and it's pubG as well) is people that just get a gun and sit in a random corner of a house so they make no noise. They will literally sit there for 15 minutes if needs be and you die so fast that if you don't peek at the right corner 9/10 times you're just dead. No way of knowing if they are there and slowing the game down 200% because now I have to try and check ever single corner of every single room I enter so it takes 2 minutes to clear a house.I think a workaround in this game would be nice such as, because it's cold weather, if you sit still for too long your character gets progressivly colder and under a certain degrees makes heavy breathing sounds than can be heard at least just from the next room along. It would help identify if someone is just sitting in a corner waiting for you so you at least hasve a chance to defend yourself.",1

But. Theres a big but.The buissness model is simly awful. this should not be in the free to play section. but in a new section called Free to Pay. As the game will try to squeeze every penny it can out of you. What you do get for free. is a low caliber bolt action hunting rifle. With unlimited ammunition. a pair of binoculars. and a little bit of camping supplies for fast travel (consumables) The game features two currencys. Quite usual for the Free to play market. Yet also has a subscription! And one does not grant you the olther! Subscription or ""Membership"" Will grant you a ""License"" To hunt all animals. But the rifle you start with is not ""Ethical"" for all of them. thus you will have to spend even more money to actually take part in competitons. or get score for theese animalsEM$: A currency used to get absolutly everything the ratio is 100 EM$ = Dollar. But the smallest package you can buy is 500. for 5 dollars. the larger packages save you a little bit of cash. EM$ Is the currency used to buy about anything. Clothing. weapons and so on. Yet a single item will cost you 3-7 dollars. For just a single item. ""Happy Camper tents"" Will cost you 550 EM. But there is no 550 Package. Forcing you to spend more money!While there are competitions in game with EM Prizes. To get to them. you will most likely have to spend money. Again!GM$: An in game currency. You might think that you get GM from hunting animals. And you'd be wrong. All you get is score. in a phatetic attempt to squeeze more money out of you. GM is earned by compleating missions. theese have a finite number. and most of them require you to use a peticular weapon or hunt an animal you will not have acsess too. without opening your wallet up. And do not ague that the microtransaction system lets you have ""Choice"" As it does not. The design of the game. maps. liceances. all of that is under the influance to squeeze more MONEY out of you wallet. And it will not stop untill you have everything. And once you do. They will still try and squeeze money out of you on a monthly basis. EIther have microtransactions. or a subscription. having both is disgusting.  ",0
15027,"Early Access ReviewI've clocked over 1000 hours on this game, and a lot of money. It has changed from being progressive, challenging and rewarding to being stagnant, tedious and insulting.  I used to play this for a few hours most nights, but if I now log a couple of hours a month then I'm doing well.The direction of the game has completely changed. A while ago, there was an aim to work towards, I recognised a lot of players, even teamed with some of them.  Now, I don't recognise anyone, nobody chats, and at the end of a game, you just receive spare parts that you can scrap for a fraction of their value; this contributes to the tedium.It is such a shame as I really enjoyed the game, both building bots and taking part in battles.

13016,The combat system in this game is stupid... The visuals are not representative of what is actually determining the outcome of the combat.It is just time based like everything else in this game... Here is an example... If you have 2 people shooting at 3 radroaches the roaches will die at random times even when your people are not shooting at them... And your people will suffer damage overtime by the enemies just being in the room with them... The equipment and weapons you stick on your people just improve these times but there is no real combat even going on in this game.And this was what i thought the meat of the game could have been... But everything in this game is just timers timers timers... Nothing at all else... Not the combat or the exploration... building or relationships between your people... It is all just timers and randomness.Its lazy game design. ,0

That's also F2P and a card game so you shouldn't demonotize this game!""There's many issues I've seen so far on this game.-No Fullscreen. Like what the heck, I wanna be immersed into this seemingly great story and universe, while not seeing either the Steam Page or my wallpaper.-Packs are awful, card navigation is even worse. Compared to Shadowverse, whereby you click a card and there's information about where this pack is from, here, I have no damn clue on where to get some of the other cards that support the current ""box expansion"". I would like to suggest some letters or something that indicates where the card is from. Anything, other than god awful navigation we have today. In Shadowverse, you get 7 cards in a pack. Here, only 3. And you need to like refresh the box to get another SR if you got it from the first one? Realistic? Yes, very much. Annoying and grindy? Oh yeah.-Grind for items to create cards/buy packs. Now, I know, I don't mind grinding for cards that I need. You have Hearthstone, that you grind for the Gold and Dust, Gold for buying Adventure and Pack and Dust for . In Shadowverse, you grind Vials for cards and Gold for packs. Here, you grind items such as: Gold for specific cards from a Card Dealer, Gems for packs/structure deck, and keys(Water, Fire, Dark...) for the Gate World, and Stones(Water, Fire, Dark....) for the Card Dealer(specific cards), and Jewel (R,SR...). There's so many to keep track of that I forgot how many currency type this game had.-Stage Mission. Some people like this, making it sort of a progression system. I hate it though, because it restrict freedom and causing the game to be a bit linear and not making it fluid.-No japanese voices. Isn't this from a Japanese game? Why is Korean voice included but not Japanese? I love Kaiba's Japanese voice.-Some cards are just...come out of nowhere. Archfiend Palabryinth is in the game but so far, no Archfiend cards? There's Gravekeeper's cards, but no Necrovalley... Monarch so far I've seen is the Frost Monarch. (I know there's maybe more but if I navigate the card shop and I got lost, that means that the card shop needs rearrangement.)-Can't choose the characters immediately. Wanna play Mai? Then you had to stick to either to Yugi or Kaiba to grind it so that you can get her. I actually want to play Pegasus due to my love for Relinquish+Toon monster combo. However I can't because I'm not there yet.These are some points in which I think the game did decent enough.+Music and voice acting are quite decent. To a point where I love some of the voice actors. Though I wish the entire game is voice acted.+3x3 Zone with 4000Lp. I don't mind this at all.

Now it turned into extremely unballanced, rage-inducing, crate-opening pay to win game.A huge tank with lots of weapons and shields can be easily taken out by a tiny drone that was lucky enough to unbox an epic missile launcher. And don't even think about flying higher than 5 meters; the game has many ways to counter aircraft, however there is no way for the aircraft themselves to counter ground attacks. There is no way to deflect an incomming missile, no way to jam enemy radars (which also are not a thing anymore).All the screenshots are nice, but do not expect to see anything like that in the game itself. The most efficient way to play is to just create a wide gunbed and mindlessly throw guns at it.Yes of course there are special devices like the ghost module or the jump drive or whatever is it called, but those will not help you because 95% of your opponents will just be spraying area damage all over the place.I haven't played this game a lot, but I have experienced all of it in last couple years, and I can say that it is one of those rare early access games that started with a great and complex gameplay, only to get over-simplyfied and spoiled by people willing to pay money for easier gameplay. Just look at flying; it used to be difficult to build an airplane, you had to put engines on without throwing the balance off, now you don't need engines at all, the wings have in-built hover thrusters. Getting in the air is just a matter of holding spacebar on a single spot.Before, you had to have radar on your robot that would help you locate enemies, you could share your radar coverage with allies using network relays, you could have radar jammers that would make you invisible to enemies with weaker radars, you could play with no weapons only as a scout or a stealth recon aircraft.Now - all that is gone. No radars, no jammers, no relays.There were only three main weapon types; SMGs with low damage but relatively fast firing speed for close-range combat, plasma cannons with high damage output, low fire rate and with artillery projectiles for medium range, and laser rifles for long range combat. You had to find balance between these weapons and you had to learn how to use them properly.Now all you need are flaks with high damage, high fire rate and long range, or missiles that lock on and can't be countered at all.Would I recommend it? Only if you have enough spare money to spend on crates or enough patience to keep dying (or rich parents, ya never know)",0

Billed as an ""Arctic Warfare"" survival game where you must brave the ""Ymir"" storm and fight your way to be one of the 4 who can board the rescue helicopter at the end. A unique snow setting works well as the first map to be released for the game. Amazing winter effects combine with 3 unique classes: A Glider with a small pack, a Snowboarder with a medium sized backpack, and an Ice Climber with the ability to carry a lot of items. Use vehicles to race across the tundra as the blizzard closes off areas on the map. Prepare for an intense final battle where players are shown at regular intervals as red pings, and smoke grenades and cold snow cover the rope ladder leading up to the escape helicopter. An island map, as well as customizable gliders, snowoards, and backpacks among other things are coming as free updates. Best of all? It's FREE!

960,"Early Access ReviewI had this on my wishlist for a while and was afraid to pull the trigger because I kept reading that term MOBA.  I enjoy some MOBA type games like Awesomenauts.  I used to play LoL until it wasn't fun anymore because the community became toxic and it was hard to find games where people just played it to have fun.  Every match became way too intense with all the meta rules and immature people.  And I'm really happy to say that so far 'Fractured Space' has NOT been like that at all.  It's been a really enjoyable experience so far.  Game runs awesome, with zero problems on my rig.  (Intel i5 4670, 780 GTX SC, 8GB Ram).  The longest I've waited to get into a game is about 5 minutes.  People are either quiet or helpful, I'm sure they're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s out there but I haven't run into them yet.  Games are strategic but very hectic and loose (your mom's hectic and loose) at the same time.The tutorials are short and not annoyingly overcomplex.  It's not pay2win, everything is earnable, save for a couple ships you can buy, but everything is balanced so no one ship is OP over another.I was worried I'd regret this purchase, that I'd go into games and think ""oh here we go again, some game junkie yelling at people for not following his grand plan and some meta"" because some of us don't have 100 hours / week to study every minute detail of a game.  Instead I've actually had fun playing this and when I'm not playing I'm actually anxious to play it again.",1

3784,"Well, since I got a fair bit of playtime on this game, I think it would be time to write a real review. (Never wrote reviews before, so I'll just do some pros and cons and then my opinion).I think there is a lot of positives and negatives, so here are some of them!Pros-TF2 is for me a game of unlimited fun. I'm over 4000 hours now, and still find it just as enjoyable as first time I started up the game.-It's a good first person shooter for players who don't have a lot of experience with first person shooters. But it's also challenging for experienced gamers, because there is a lot of difrent classes, and even more difrent playstyles. -It's friendly for all ages. It's easy to pick up for smaller kids, but also holds an interest for ''older'' players.-Like in CS:GO there are also community servers, which bring even more playmodes, mods and almost difrent games to the table.Cons-The matchmaking is still not working 100% correctly. You still sometimes get in a game where it's 5 vs 10. And sometimes everybody from one team leaves, and it takes up to hours for new players to join, so in the meantime it's a really unbalanced match. -The updates are still dissapointing to me. When they come out, they are extremly poorly done, and it takes many months for the updates to get to a decent completion. Example; Meet your Match came out many months ago (I don't remember the exact date), and it has just recently in my opinion, gotten to a decent state.This game means so much to me, I've spend so so many hours in it, and none of them has been boring.I can only recommend this game!",1

16196,Usually I'm not a big fan of clicker games but in this case I'm pretty impressed. With every step you go further there's more content to unlock that keeps you interested in the game.

Bases vary in importance and have lattice links so there is a sense of progression when taking them and involves strategic thinking.+ Any minor event such as sneaking around your enemy on foot and destroying a sunderer can have a significant impact of the battle for the entire continent which can give exhilarating feelings.+ There are many organised outfits and platoons on every server with every faction that are friendly and willing to take on new players, but also there is the freedom to play solo. Play how you wish to.+ If you are willing to pay for them, There is a wide range of cosmetics that give you the ability to stand out.+ Out of the 800+ hours I have played this (200 hours before realizing it was on steam), I have only ever encountered 1 hacker who was in a flying max, which was in 2014.

Especially annoying when you are in the process of deploying a sunderer somewhere or are advancing with a MBT which wastes nanites.

9238,"Pros:Fair and balanced: Yes, you do have to put in some work to develop your character and unlock items, instead of whining about not getting handed everything right off the bat, I find this makes the game EXCITING...Tactical:  You pick your weapons, items, gear, and vehicles that you take into combat.Strategic:  You can join outfits and be a part of large-scale maneuvers that lead your faction to victory.Team-based: You need your teammates to support you in almost every situation.  Slow long range combat: Especially in armored combat, a lot of the game is patiently waiting for the opportune moment to strike.Reflexive fast paced CQB: Every base requires an infantry element to take points.  As forces collapse on these points, you get fast-paced combat where you turn the corner, and whoever is better at quickly dodging around, aiming, and pulling different tricks (grenades, flashbangs, flanking, max crashing, cloaking, the list of moves you can pull goes on and on) ultimately wins.Massive battles: The game is huge and sometimes you get 300 man battles out in the open, through buildings, and maneuvering about the battlefield.Factions: Each faction has its own fighting style.  TR is basically bullrush your enemy and shoot a lot. NC seems to be hunker down and advance slowly and decisively. I don't even know what the VS are about because I would never ever under any circumstances ever play for the VS so help me, but they seem to be the tactical high-tech fancy-pants spandex faction.  These are all generalizations btw, everyone develops their own style.Cons:It is very difficult for new players, but for people who are determined and enjoy a challenge, this game is probably the most exciting game I've ever played.Graphics are outdated, but this is what you get when you are playing a game with hundreds of other people logged on and in combat.Lag can be a problem and sometimes you die simply because your frame rate's lower than your enemy's...very annoyingAnnoying leaders can be a huge issue, luckily there are a decent number of professional outfits out there and literally...professional leaders, some of them are incredibly good at commanding, its kind of disturbing actually.Finally, the other thing I find annoying is how there is a primetime, where everyone is online, and then downtime, wehre not many people are online.

8140,I've played Neverwinter for a few years now and and a D&D and Forgotten Realms fan. This isn't anything like Neverwinter Nights depite being called the successor to that game. Neverwinter Nights was a true RP experience if you played on the player made permanent worlds and this game is a standard MMO. I do enjoy it for what it is. I like the crafting system and you can still levle up your characters without actually questing if you are high enough level to pray to your diety. It's improving all the time and is very solo friendly.The big negative in this game is the cost of the DLC. I don'y ever pay for in game currency and you can play this game without it but it does restrict you. It takes an age to farm enough crystals to convert to Zen which is what you need to buy things. What does interest me in the market is the packs that allow you to play other races but the cost is extortionate. To but a pack that includes  new race it's the equivalent of £40. If you played half a day everyday for weeks you might just be able to make just enough to afford that.

But the main fun to have here is the Air and Land battle fought between the factions, in a normal battle for a base you would see dozens of other players battle it out with very little air and a ton of tanks, but when battling with or against a clan, you would see a minumum amount of tanks, but a sky full of troop transports with other player dropping down to try and claim the base.Tons of fun to be had in this game.8/10",1
3000,"At it current state(1.81) is to expensive to play the game, if you don't have premium account you can't progress at all because of the repair cost and even if you do have you can't make mistakes if you want to have enough Silver Lions to buy another vehicle, stock vehicle are the worst, planes isn't that much but you still can feel a difference, the big problem here are mainly tanks were if you don't have repairs and FPE(extinguisher) you are useless if they get any of the parts of the tank unless you get to the capture point to repair (if they get your engine you can't do anything), matchmaking is too compressed so sometimes you get games where your tank or your plane lacks too much compared to others and still with the compression  takes some time to get into battle depending on your Rank(if you don't get a small game with 6-8 people, wich are decided on the first 3min of the game), this game have become a P2W or even worst than that because at it current state premium isn't helping that much, a premium vehicle and account are a must if you want to grind anything or even play(keep in mind that you can only reasearch vehicles of the same nation that your premium vehicle is), can't recommend this game at all anymore if you want to have fun and even spend money into something i would recommend World of Tanks(Warships or Planes) those games aren't perfect too,  but are in a better state or even buy a game from steam that will be better.",0

Actually with a big enough wallet time faction can deal with everything without the need for synergy.GG direwolf.In response to developer comment:I see your claim and it might be true on the data you've certainly collected or on tournament results.After 185 hours played i have grown a reasonable collection, dusted and crafted cards and tried a decent number of self-brewed decks or net-decked serious high-tier contenders from eternalwarcry.Currently my rank is in high silver and the decks i face on a regular basis can be identified at turn 2, turn 3 max. Some of them run placeholders but the number of cards played versus the amount of cards that exist (and can be easily aquired for free - i grant you that) is far from perfect.I will reconsider this review when:- The power level difference between cards and/or the aquisition rate improves (yes you get many cards but most of them get dusted anyways and the exchange rate is worse than any other major CCG has)- Matchmaking improves meaning you dont face a 30%+ legendary deck with yours that barely has 4 of themIn it's current form simply cannot recommend this game to newcomers.

8653,"Early Access ReviewI'll be honest, when I downloaded this game I thought I'd uninstall it after 1-2 matches. Six hours after the fact I found I was up several hours past what I should of been and looked forward to playing again the next day.

You'll still do decently well, but don't expect to get ez ability wins like you would get from OW.If you're good, great!

The control are ok, but it having too much options and it pretty hard to memorize 30+ commands here, if you don't have a racing wheel for your computer, you're going to taste the wall all the time. It could be fun to see a gameplay that is keyboard friendly here, because the game seem to force you to buy a racing wheel. The graphics are great, the 3D models of the cars are amazing, and a lots of polygon are on them, but since they have a huge numbers of polygon, like I said before, even a good computer will suffer from video lagging.

The motor sound flat, and not like a ""ROAR""!!!!The main menu isn't friendly at all, since with the new update, I got much more trouble to start a race than before, oh, and the stuff that need to be bought, like cars and tracks are not identified correctly...Another thing that not cool is to play online, you need to buy the DTM experience pack, isn't the game supposed to be free???I do not recommend this game for gamers that never played racing simulator before, but give it a try, maybe you will like it, maybe not.I prefer other racing simulator like Gran Turismo or Live For Speed(and LFS is keyboard friendly), but Raceroom Racing Experience is not a game, it a demo with extremely limited content if you don't buy the DTM experience...

13005,"TL;DR - Fallout Shelter is fun for what it is - a quick diversion while you drop the kids off at the pool, or when things are slow at work, etc. I played the game on my phone for a couple weeks and maxed out my dwellers and rooms, and so forth. Opinions and things of note from my playthrough:It's a pseudo-strategy upgrade'em up, vault-building farmville-like game that is also reminiscent of Sim Tower. The comic art-style is well executed with cutesy and fun animations and effects which the dwellers exhibit while carrying out their lives.Bonerkill Alert: Grabbing and dragging dwellers is awkward and inaccurate, even on PC, especially when zoomed out -> grabbing them accurately requires zooming in, but moving them to where they need to go often requires zooming out again.DOUBLE BONERKILL ALERT: The emphasis on microtransactions in Fallout Shelter are disappointing, although not unexpected considering the original platform and target audience.Entitled gamer conclusion: It's unfortunate that Bethesda used their time and effort, and this great IP to make a weak mark on it's legacy. I think I speak for many fans when I say we would have been happier to pay outright for a more serious entry for mobile platforms, perhaps something along the lines of Fallout/II/Tactics.",0

8759,"Early Access ReviewSo, this is gonna be a mixed review of this game because I'm a person who enjoyed the game when it first came to Steam, and a person who now hates it in it's current form. However, the reccommendation is gonna be ""No"" for my situation only. Read below for further detail, if you wish.The reason being:When the game first launched on Steam, and I mean JUST went up, almost anyone could run this game, even me, with my 5 year old laptop (and that's saying a lot because this thing has lost it's ability to run most games smoothly like Team Fortress 2). However, as time went on, and the game recieved more and more updates, it was harder for myself (and possibly others who are currently in my situation) to run this game. Games kept freezing up, not allowing me to do anything once I've actually got into a game, and after I loaded into the Zepplin at the LAST second, fall onto the island (with hard frame drops falling down), I completely freeze. By the time my toaster computer responds, I'm dead, and the game goes to black screen. tl;dr Game runs poorly for me nowAm I against this for others interested?No, absolutely not. If you have a newish computer, probably a year or two old, and you're looking for a FREE game to play to pass the time, then try this one. It's completely free to play, you can give it a shot in trying it out, and it's just as easy to uninstall as it is to install it if this isn't the type of game for you. Don't let the above bit about my situation discourage you from trying the game out.tl;dr NoWould you consider giving a different opinion on this game if you had a gaming setup?Absolutely.  ",0

OverWatch on the other hand is just a very similar class based shooter to Team Fortress 2.

1705,"""sooka ♥♥♥♥♥ noob report"" - your average friendly Russians""Well played!""  - chat bind used in a mocking way""DROP YOUR STICK""- EternaLEnVy leading his team in a professional wayDota 2 is the leading game of the MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) genre developed by Valve Software, released in 2011. In Dota 2, players in teams of five control various heroes and abilities in a bid to utterly crush the enemy in a pointless waste of 30-60 minutes.* GameplayDota 2 largely follows the experience of the original Dota All Stars mod: you pick a hero of your choice and get assigned to the Radiant or Dire (formerly known as Sentinel and Scourge) faction with the objective of destroying the enemy's Ancient. Protecting the Ancients is maintained by towers and barracks which ensure lane equilibrium and creep strength. Heroes are initially very weak and must rely on creeps (faceless grunts) to obtain starting gold from which options to start pushing begin, as well as experience which enables leveling up abilities. Abilities range from:   Deal damage (and maybe a status effect)  Inflict a positive or negative buff  Area of effect damage/positive or negative buff  Utilities  Global effects While laning is the main way to gain gold and experience, alternate choices are fighting neutral creeps in the jungle (usually done by very specific heroes) or challenging the mighty Roshan, who drops the fabled Aegis of the Immortal (resurrect on death). In order to maintain the advantage, certain nuances of the game must be learned:  Last hitting/denying (ensuring/denying gold and experience)  Camp stacking (having a single jungle camp hold more creeps than intended)  Creep pull (having allied and neutral creeps fight each other to shift lane equilibrium)  Map vision (prevents ambushes)Of course, having a good Dota 2 experience is defined by your teammates, who may be either incompetent or singlehandedly taking on the entire enemy team and winning. Communication and teamwork are vital, thus it is recommended to play with friends, although it doesn't ensure victory.* Hero roles and balanceEach hero has a set of 4 abilities that have synergy with each other or other heroes' abilities, but more importantly, each has a specific role:  Carry/hard carry - heroes that need a lot of gold and levels to get the ball rolling  Support/hard support - heroes that excel at supporting carries in early stage, and usually   buy support items and stack camps   Jungler - heroes that spend early game in jungle, then ambushing lanes at level 6A hero is not forced to follow a role, although using highly unorthodox tactics will most likely earn you the scorn of your team, possibly giving you a trip to the low priority queue, filled with Russians and similar  friendly  people. Dota 2 often changes with large updates that give heroes buffs or nerfs, change certain mechanics or simply iron out bugs and glitches. The most popular heroes tend to be the ones that have an easy way of dominating games, making you have a hard time if they aren't on your team, although learning to counter them is a great learning experience.* Other interests in Dota 2If you get bored (and you will) of right clicking at the time, the game offers the option of following various e-sport leagues, the biggest being the yearly International hosted by Valve, and famous players (such as Dendi, EternaLEnVy and so on) which set many gameplay trends and strategies. There is also the large economy which is mostly based on altering the looks of heroes and the game, but with no pay-to-win options, except maybe gaudy gold cosmetics. Finally, every Chinese New Year/Halloween/Christmas a slightly different game mode is introduced, thus making the game slightly less stale.* Closing commentsDota 2 is a fairly well made game which offers many hours of play, although the relatively unchanging experience and hostile people may spoil your enjoyment. Personally, I wouldn't suggest getting too involved as you will become highly misanthropic, although I wouldn't say it is a bad game.",0

10588,"Early Access ReviewEternal combines the best parts of Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering to create a CCG experience that is similar to both but unlike either. MTG players will recognize mechanics similar to lands, dual lands, instants, five different mana colors, and battle mechanics like trample, deathtouch, lifesteal, first strike, and flying. Because this game is digital, it can do things that you could never do with physical MTG cards, like the Warcry mechanic that add +1/+1 to the top unit of your deck when you attack. There are much fewer RNG elements here than Hearthstone, and some nice of themes to build your deck around like an army of valkyries, a gang of gunslingers, a pack of dniosaurs, or suicidal grenadins.Progression feels so much more rewarding than in Hearthstone! In addition to daily quests, you also get a free card pack for your first win of the day, and these packs have TWELVE cards instead of five AND include enough crafting materials to make a common or uncommon card of your choice. Yes, you get crafting materials IN the card packs! You also get gold for every win (not every 3 wins) which can be spent on card packs. There is also a leveling system in place for each of the 5 factions (red, blue, green, black, and white). When you level up in a faction, you get additional rewards like gold or a free pack, and XP is earned based on the decks you play. So focus on one or two colors to level those up faster, or run a rainbow deck (and there are some GREAT rainbow decks) to level up all five evenly.You have the typical PvP modes like casual, ranked, and a draft pick that is extraodinary! After you pay the entry fee, you open a bunch of randomized card packs and then pick and pass to create a pool, and from that pool you create a deck. It's almost exactly like something you'd see at a MTG event. There are also PvE modes here. The Gauntlet has you fight AI opponents using any custom decks you've created, and Forge is like Hearthstone's draft pick mode. There are a few campaigns that have a steep entry fee but give you guaranteed rewards.All in all, I really enjoy Eternal far more than Hearthstone or Magic. And oh yeah, there is a mobile app as well, so I can play on the bus to work. I've played a lot of digital card games (Hearthstone, Gwent, Faeria, Duelyst, Legends) and Eternal ranks #1 in my book.",1

(are they gonna make a vampire dragon sometime? maybe)but that doesnt matter, right? it's about the gameplay. -the quests attempt to be educational. that's fine, if you're still in elementary school and need a bit of a review. but most of the time its just running back and forth either delivering/getting items or just plain out talking to like five people in a row without doing♥♥♥♥♥♥ even then some of the quests you cant even complete, because you need a GODDAMN MEMBERSHIP. -flying your dragon is legit the only feature i enjoy at this point, not even kidding. it's the most detailed and fluid part of the game(god i wish the rest of the game was too). your viking is a slow♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so you gotta opt for flying, which is fine by me because who doesn't want  to ♥♥♥♥ around and shoot fireballs everywhere?-battle events are brief, but fun and worth the rewards. they really are, mayne. i got 3rd place although i'm basically a newbie with a free knock-off night fury. now for the cons.-glitchy as ♥♥♥♥. i think enough other players have mentioned the buggy♥♥♥♥♥dark side of this game. but seeing the outdated graphics, im not surprised. just get this♥♥♥♥♥♥fixed.-it's pay to play. no need to explain further here-gems are required for the majority of the other activities for the game. continue flight club lessons? gems!buy new content to complete a quest? gems! or real money, really!make your sheep in your farm♥♥♥♥♥♥out wool? gems!buy a new fishing rod? gems! buy fish you really need to finish an annoying quest? gems!and more!-membership is required for the majority of the other activities for the game. see above-game looks half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and♥♥♥♥♥♥out after a week's worth of work. it really does, man. and after my redundant points of the 2006 graphics, need i say more?-chests are rigged. you know those random sparkling chests that you see around the place? yeah, the chances of getting good♥♥♥♥♥♥from them is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing rigged like the rest of this game, or i have♥♥♥♥♥♥luck. i opened 2 of them which had 90% dragon eggs, and the other 10% saddles or some statues or something. both of them i got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ saddles that i cant even use on my dragon because they're for other breeds, which basically makes them useless. just another example of p2pedit: scratch that. the chests arent rigged. but theres still a problem. they show you a ""preview"" of whats in the chest, such as dragon eggs(mostly), and make you believe theres some ♥♥♥♥ing stash in there when in reality theres only fish you can easily catch. i opened 2 for 90 gold and thought it was too good to be true and well, it was. my fault for not recognizing that dragon eggs arent worth 90 gold, but the majority of your playerbase is little kids. really now?-new problem, regarding accounts. more specifically, changing the password.so i forgot my username a few days ago for some reason, and was trying to bust a password change so i could get it back. i eventually remembered my user again, and tried to log in with the new password i got sent. it didnt work.how? i dont know. but i tried my previous password that i made the account with at first, and i logged in. ...i'm already confused at this point.i'm trying to change my password now from the mess of letters and numbers they send you, to my usual password. i try both the account details and player details, putting in the sent pw in the ""old pw"" section and then adding the password i want it changed to. neither worked, and i'm fuming with how difficult this interface is.it wont let you log in with your sent password, but will with your previous? as well as not accepting your sent password by email when you try to change it manually? is this some kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ security measure? it can work maybe, but it's so ♥♥♥♥ing confusing for the 99% of people who dont have their accounts compromised. i dont know how 10 year olds play this game if I'M confused with the interface of just changing your ♥♥♥♥ing password.summary:when you change your password, and get the sent emailyou have to use the password before that to log inand when you want to access your account settingsyou have to use the recent password.GET THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥CHANGED.long story cut short i forgot how much this game sucked♥♥♥♥♥ overall, this game needs an EXTREME overhaul. i pray to god that someone better fitting of a developer(or developers) take over and fix it up a tad. even if its not the entire game, it needs a serious fix up in at least one part and i hope it goes into better hands- or the current developers get some common sense and fix it themselves.-a basically 5-year-player-with-no-life(but im still gonna play the game, because riding a dragon is fun)",0

2864,"Here is my real review, plain and simple... on my 5 year anniversary date of being an active die hard player...AUG 22 2013... Started Playing War Thunder *(not on steam)*Today:AUG 19 2018.... 4,900 hours recorded (on steam)I have been around for 5 years and put in over 5,000 hours..Supported this game the whole way..  VERY HEAVILY. * also with no regrets* $17,219 USD to date with almost $4K gifted threw squadrons...I have experienced the WHOLE scene from casual to highly competitive... solo, to squadrons... new member, to ""guy in charge""....Unfortunately they are loosing me, seriously... (i'm only a very casual player now) *maybe it is life, or maybe it is GAIJIN...* (I'm inclined to think it is GAIJIN's fault as I'd rather play other games after trying to enjoy this one..)The Issues?Well they have quite seriously have gotten WORSE over time..Bugs, Vehicle matching issues, map layouts and gameplay dynamics, broken promises with naval, steep price gouging reaching out of control levels, toxic moderator and developer community, events that are unrealistic in both time and scope, forcing of a marketplace, implementation of a ""pay to play"" model where they increasingly make it harder for people to progress in an significant way, pay to win mentality... THE LIST GOES ON...Overall the game developers have lost sight of what they set out to do, and greed and control became what they were about. It was a great expeince, but in the end simply a disppointing direction. Keep in mind that if you do get into this game, or start to become invested in it in some way... the developer and moderating community has progressed backwards... Be prepared to be very disppointed if you actually have to deal with them in anyway or want to encourage discussions or suggest ideas.My rating?4/10.... Not worth the effort needed given the direction... ",0

At a first glance it might look like Hearthstone, but it plays more like Magic the Gathering.

14470,"Early Access ReviewScore: 2/10 Date: (5/16/16) Update: Epic LootThe newest update ""Epic Loot"" has effectivly put a nail in the coffin for an otherwise great game.Pros: - Graphics are passable- Gameplay is conditionally good if you have high level rails from before the epic loot update.Cons:- Pay to win- Pay astronimical amount to win.- After paying an astronomical amount you will still need to randomly get rails in crates, or legendary IONs to compete with players who bought them in the previous update.- Cirtain weapons are pretty much pointless, nanos, smgs, tesla and plasma all fall short of rails.- A single high teir mech leg with an ion on it garentees you a win.- Matchmaker regularly puts your 300 point bot with 1500 point bots if you do well and will do it more often now as players leave.- The price of premium is 30$ a month if you buy it a day at a time like I used to and it doesn't give you anything really.- Sometimes your rails if you do have them randomly do not fire.- Often being the best player on your team will net you an inferior crate just because you happen to be on the losing team.- Random disconects will boot you off and them make you wait to get in a match considering you the same as a character that quit.- Freejam says everything is fine, just look at the recent reviews, they tell a very very ugly tale...",0
14738,"Early Access ReviewThere is so much I want to say, but others have done it better than I ever could already. Basically, Freejam is taking this game in a direction that's destroying what made the idea of it fun and unique. They refuse to listen to the community and insist because ""new user retention rates are high"", their decisions are good decisions. The retention rate is higher because new users are logging in daily for their free crate. Freejam is cherrypicking their data to insist what they're doing instead of listening to user suggestions and criticism is what's best. I won't stop playing until it's unbearable to do so, but my hope for this game's future is rapidly running out.",0
16101,"Another free-to-play clicker game.The graphics are a bit shabby. The game moves at a decent pace, but not too slow that you'll lose interest. They don't shove paid upgrades in your face. There's versatility (you can choose a faction) & good options for passive income if you want to enjoy the clicker format without going click-click-click all the time.Good fun, already played just under 150 hours in the last two months!",1
4852,"from my hours on just the steam version you can tell that i have played this game a great deal, I have been playing this game since the beta a few years ago and I have loved playing this game ever since then and seeing all the gods or changes that they add to the game to make it more fun. I play this game every day and when ever im bored its my go to game to play. I would 100% reccomend this to someone its even free so you may aswell try it for a few games and see if you like it the only thing you can spend money on is cosmetic skins for the game no pay to win factor to it.",1
16783,"Access ReviewThe graphics is incredible, even on with all settings on low.  Day looks like day, the sun reflects off slippery surfaces beautifully, trees and landscrape is nicely done, and the river stream makes me want to take a dip.Gameplay is strange. I'm getting killed from insane distances that when I try the same thing it seems like my guns have limited range, but certain other players' don't. Can't even readily tell when I make a kill - put player specific kill messages top center, it's much easier to see. Next, I can get killed by a melee attack with a ♥♥♥♥ing blunt force weapon and die instantly even with full armor, yet my weapons seem to have no effect up close - and no I'm not a lousy shot. I'm coming from games like Doom, Gears of War and the Unreal Tournament franchise. And why is there not a full list of players in server? Frames, but no ping readout?The lobby screen - why not show a list of gaming sessions players can join instead of having them wait on the slow poke search? Like multiplayer games traditionally do? I've waited up to 10 minutes to join - not nice in a game with no respawn and where if you die you must reconnect to the server.Lastly, Battle Royale is a lame and annoying genre.  I don't know why every damn game studio is getting on that bandwagon since PUBG released. It's not ground breaking and it gets old fast. It seems like the gaming industry is going the way of china, bootleg after bootleg knock off after knock off. The games all seem the same - you jump out of some plane parachute style (Cuisine Royale is an exception) and do nothing but run around collecting inventory items and guns (that you sometimes can't find in THIS game, so you die - kinda unfair so you end up bringing a knife to a gun fight but whatever), all while some ominous fog is trying to kill you or get shot outta no where. It's literally death match with the exception being the players invests more time doing stupid shiate and playing hide and seek while grinding for the most kills. It's more depressing than fun. I can't recommend this or any other BR games to be honest, paid or free.",0
10624,"Early Access ReviewHaving played Hearthstone, Gwent, Magic Online and Duels, and even Yu Gi Oh, Pokemon, and other samplings of card games, none have kept me coming back quite like Eternal. It's based most on Magic; you construct a deck of 75 or more cards using any of the five available colors and play power (or lands) in order to pay for units and spells.Most card games, when you start out, you have very uninteresting cards and it's a long grind to gain packs, but Eternal starts you out with one legendary for each color and gives players gauntlet and forge modes to play against AI and earn in-game currency to buy more packs. It also features a draft mode where you open a pack, pick a card, then pass the pack to the next player and pick a card from another--all cards you pick you keep permenantly making it yet another  way players can grow a collection for free.Eternal has a great, active reddit community (https://www.reddit.com/r/EternalCardGame) to assist new players getting ramped up to speed.",1
12156,"Early Access ReviewAfter a few hours playing and reaching level 10 (i know it's not a lot of time but i had to decide, refund or waste money)Also this game has been released in other regions and has failed there miserably. ~60mil went into making it, and it feels like they are trying to get some money back for the investors.The game feels and looks 'old' and unfinished, it's from 2012 and it shows.The UI is dreadfull, open something and the game 'hangs', some things don't even work (market).Combat feels lacking, yes it's better then it was before but having no 'normal' attack feels weird. Also not being able to dodge and the 'lag attacks' makes it annoying.The stuff in the cash shop is just crap.Also when your party is at a dungeon 'teleporting/summoning' there will costs real life money.And then the market is already ruined, due to a dupe bug which was in all previous versions... the economy = ruined.Early access means nothing in this case, it's from 2012... if they didn't fix the issues in the last 6 years... they won't.",0

13883,"Last year when I first started playing this game it was really fun, I enjoyed finding guns, skins, gear and ect. Then one day when i went to play the crashed, so I tried again and the game loaded but this time the screen went black and I couldn't see anything then then it fixed its self and then started to glitch. I uninstalled the game to them fix the bugs and then later played the game again and the same problems were still there, so don't waste your time on this game.",0
3120,"For what it's worth, this is probably one of the better flying and shooting games i've played that involve WWI and WWII aircraft. It's fairly realistic, easy to learn, and easy to find a game. The graphics are decent and you can change cloud density and ground texture. This is mainly a multiplayer game, but it does offer some single player missions if you can get into it. That's pretty much where the good stuff ends, though.Given that it's Free To Play, of course the game starts you out with literally the crappiest planes they have to offer. The planes you see on as the cover art and in the screenshots? Yeah, you can't have those. It wouldn't be so bad if the matches could be ranked. But every time I joined a session, there was always somebody on the other team with a faster fighter plane that takes more hits and can kill you in two shots. Why two shots? Because you're in a ♥♥♥♥ing bi-plane from World War 1 (unless you play USA and why wouldn't you unless you're some kind of commie) and they're in a German Stuka, for example. And no, you can't fly away, because you are slow as hell. So you might as well just crash into the ground and save them the trouble. Trust me when I say the dogfights that the game hypes you up for aren't as exciting as they could be. It's usually just you being chased or the other way around and going in circles until somebody gets a lucky shot (or crashes) or the 15 other enemy players arrive to gang♥♥♥♥♥♥you with endless tracers and bullets. And to top it all off, some people in multiplayer matches have come to believe that ramming their plane into yours is a viable strategy, even though they lose their plane in the process. The point is to NOT get shot down while shooting down enemies!It is unforgiving, and you will start out very slowly. Unless you have the time and patience like some people apparently do to eventually unlock an actual decent plane, I would not recommend this.",0

It's a seemingly cute and cuddly parody of modern horror games, where you travel around a massive mansion full of terrifying monsters. For the first few minutes you wonder why you though of getting it. For the next few hours, you're running for your life from the freakiest things ever. Think cardboard cutouts aren't scary?

9393,"Never played a game that felt so unfair in my life. It's not even a matter of the game being hard, it's UNFAIRLY hard. Enemies will shoot projectiles at you that are the same color as the floor, and in situations like that the projectiles are basically completely invisible. Enemies shoot bullets in lines, and there are absolutely no i-frames whatsoever, so getting outright oneshot is a pretty common occurance. The permadeath idea is interesting in concept, but every almost every microtransaction in the game is for your character, and if you die the money you spent is just gone. That's incredibly predatory and anti-consumer.The production quality of the game is absolutely abyssmal; resizing the window will completely distort the aspect ratio of the game, fullscreening the game is a nightmare because there are buttons that just disappear. You can't even hit 'play' if you have the game at certain resolutions. You can't rebind your mouse buttons at all whatsoever, I wanted to rebind functions to my mouse and the game doesn't let you do it at all without an external program changing your moust buttons to keyboard keys. The default settings of the game in general are detrimental to you, if you don't change your settings you're playing at a disadvantage.Despite all this, I was determined to give the game a fair chance, so I did some research on how to progress and make your character stronger. Basically, the 'grind' of this game is to improve your sustainability so you can grind faster and take less damage. Grindy games can be fun, but there's no real objective to the grind in this game, no end-goal you're trying to achieve besides just maxing your characters stats, and once you max your defense you're basically in the clear for maxing the rest of your stats. The problem I found with this is that the strategy for maxing defense is to a) grind for defense up potions, or b) grind for other stat ups and trade for defense ups. Defense potions are extremely dangerous to get and put your character in extreme risk, so if you want to be as safe as possible, you'll be grinding a common dungeon called ""Sprite World"".Sprite World is an eyesore and most likely a trigger for epilepsy. In addtion there are no walls so enemies will shoot at you over pits you can't traverse over, only around, and there are conveyor belts everywhere that makes movement much more difficult than it needs to be, especailly considering that the actual enemies in the dungeon are not that threatening. So you grind dozens of Sprite Worlds to get stat ups you can trade for defense ups.But the next problem that arises is that trading in this game is inexcusably terrible. There's no auction house, no place to post your trade offers ingame, nothing. It's all handled through an external website that might not even be managed by the developers of the game.All in all, this is one of the most frustrating games I've ever played. I died a few times and not once did I feel like I had control over what happened. You can get bursted down in less than a second, and even though there's a built in 'return to town' button, the game doesn't always register it in time to save you; I had a couple occasions where I smashed the key at half-health and then just died anyway.The only redeeming factor in this game is that the community is absolutely fantastic, for some odd reason. People will just walk up to you and give you higher tiered items when you're starting out, and in turn when I found higher tier gear I couldn't use I gave it away to keep the cycle going. Most of the time people are very friendly and will actually answer your questions. This however does not make up for the fact that the game is over six years old and has zero quality of life features that make the game more user friendly. This could've been a good game if the developers cared about accessibility instead of microtransactions.",0
16833,"Early Access ReviewI love this game. Despite the lack of regions in servers section, the game is fun to play with your friends and really funny. the textures are great and the game runs really well. LOVE LOVE LOVE THE LOADING SCREEN!!!",1
14350,"Look, for a browser like game, I've never seen a game like this, at least in term of business managament and comerce.This game allows you to open your own store, hire your own workers and make items and equipments to sell to the adventurers that shows up, alongside that, you unlock new recipes of weapons of either the same type, or different type, or even reducing the crafting material count of the item, aswell as increase the chances of crafting a higher grade item.The better the item, the higher the price, but you also have social skills to use in the trade, at the cost of some hearts, you can offer a discount to gain hearts, at the cost of a less pricy item, overcharge the the item to gain more lucre at the cost of hearts, or even give a chat to the buyer to have the chance of gaining or losing hearts.There is also a second fact, if the equipment you sell to the adventurer is better than the one the adventurer is wearing, the adventurer will equip it, but nothing stops you from crafting the item yourself and giving to the adventurers, so they have some gear.Later in the game, you may even end up receiving adventurers at your shop offering you goods they found in some undisclosed location, you can bargain for lower prices before buying, or refusing to buy the item.The game also features a Mission system, which in the inn,  you can send your costumers to raid a (timed) dungeon, which after the timer runs out, you can check the result of the dungeon raid, I just don't recommend you to send your costumers to their private quests, I did those 3 times and those quests ended up failing, making the costumers unable to do missions for around 4 hours, which is a complete .Beside the most impressive fact in this game is how the Town system works, if you create or join a town, you and the other citizens can invest on the structures to unlock new characters, new workers, or even to increase the number of resource gathering per hour.The only con about the town system, is that if a citizen leaves the town, all the gold it have invested on the town structures will be gone, so you may end up even losing a character that were unlocked in the town due to that.And to finish the good part of the game, sometimes a npc surges at your shop, requesting a large number of items, when you complete that npc requests, you gain a good reward. I even had to use the market in the game to buy some of the necessary items from other players, and the good part is that they did a good price for me, so I were able to complete the npc requests.Yes, this game have a market system, you can sell the things you do for a nice price, and then later check out for lucre, or you can look on the market for a item you are looking for and then buy it for the best price as possible.Now, the annoying part of the game, is that having the npcs entering and leaving your town several times can end up being boring, since it's a chore to craft and sell the items to the npc, but you can try to offer them some more expensive items disponible in the shop instead, if you have the hearts for that, and try to overprice for a nice lucre.There is a limit for almost everything in the game, like furnitures placed, workers hired, how many items you can craft at the same time, and even workers you can have.You can buy the expansion for the coins you make selling items for npcs and players, or by using gems that are the game cash item, but if you don't meet the level requirement for the upgrade, the price will be insane (like, you make around 5k coins with some sales, the price of the upgrade is 300k because you have not the level for it), and sometimes you will feel like needing the upgrade, but will be unable to buy it because of the insane price, that unless you spend for it.The arena is the worst part of the game, you first join the arena to be shamefully beaten, you may end up finding a enemy player with characters of ten times more might than your characters, which is very absurd and primitive, the game should try to find challenge based on around the player might, so the battle have some chance of winning, and the tutorial arena fight you can't even refuse, so you are forced to lose miserably.Almost customization items in the game are only by gems, while a few coin customization and upgrades are unlocked by levels, generally, only 1 furniture or customization is unlocked per level.So, there is my review, the game is not really that bad, but at the first day, you may end up addicted so...Don't forget to eat something, like someone here.

15144,"Early Access ReviewI played this game about a year back (i stopped shortly after they released legs) And came back now to see what happened to the game in the meantime. For someone who really enjoyed how the game used to work, it's a big disappointment now. The removal of blocks with different durabilities might have been a defendable change, since some might argue that it turned the game into a bit of a grind, but replacing it with a system built on loot crates with random contents and weapons as different rarity drops makes no sense in this kind of game. The ""healing"" of damage dealt to your robot (at least in the gamemodes where you can actually find a game in a reasonable time) might be nice if it happens to you, but is utterly frustrating when a fast enemy just escapes from your view to return unharmed a few seconds later. For me the fun in the early stages of robocraft was in building a robot with multiple propulsion systems and failsafes to make sure i can still fight after taking damage, it was in batteling a crippeled enemy while trying to angle my weapon with my one remaining leg. Of cause it takes away waiting time from the game, but the cost is a lot of what made robocraft unique.It seems like someone decided to take the regeneration of a modern shooter (without taking into account how little sense that makes for robots), the lootcrate system of Overwatch (with the difference that the crates actually contain stuff that changes the gameplay, making it almost pay to win) and the slow progression of Warframe (which is worse since the game is PvP not PvE so the loadout actually matters).I can see how players like some of these changes and i can see how players that played a lot and dont mind to spend some money from time to time will still enjoy the game, but i would not pick it up as a new player, there are better f2p games out there and i would not come back to it if you enjoyed it when it first started. I uninstalled it again; it's a shame, i really enjoyed the original robocraft.",0

15184,"Early Access ReviewIf I could turn back time... Back to the good old days..... Seriously. The game used to BE AMAZING. the community was wonderful, i had some really cool machines it was fun, easy to play, learn and be creative. I even spent some money and laughed and laughed and has so much fun. This was the game i used to always play. Now everything fun i can remember is gone. The balance, its pay to win, it was so cooooool. I even buil a really fast flyer thats now trash... I mean come on. It's no longer creatively make a cool robot yourself its buy a bunch of stuff and do what everyone else is doing. Used to be fun but now...... I just cant' man. Maybe a bit too ""polished"" sorry i cant grind your game for hours a day im an A student so i have other things to do i mean the game is free but the price you pay is in time, frustration, and regret. Hope this helped you man. Edit: I remember once i even mad a cool robot wolf flying healer thing and floating thingies that looked like easter eggs that were snipers and robots that i made to just smash into some one with the sword things you could put on the end that woud slice stuff up. Now all i can do is jump on the bandwagon or get left behind. Instead of all those good vets and nice people, its all just whiny kids and russians. When i played, every match people were cracking jokes in the chat and saying GLHF EVERY GAME!!! Now its just several kids who have spent money on the game whining because they suck and chewing people out which sucks and then other kids doing the same thing in russian. AND IM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE CRATES!! I CANT EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE TO YOU THE PAIN THAT BRINGS ME. JUST NO. IM UNINSTALLING YOU SQEAKY KIDS CAN RULE THE GAME FOR ALL I CARE ITS DEAD ANYWAYS.",0
10479,"I like it because it is realistic. Best hunting game I have ever played and as you can see, all the negative reviews are about having to pay to play the full game. It's a game with constant events and developments. So if you aren't willing to pay for it then it's not the game for you. Pretty simple. If people want a decent free game, then what can I say? Can't have your cake and eat it too. A one off payment wouldn't work because it is a game that is constantly updating and developing. So of course they don't make you pay for the game. You have to pay for the full privilege of the liscences and other weapons and events though. Which is fair enough imo. It's not free for the developers and they put their own time and money into it. And why shouldn't they make money out of it? It's called capitalism. And btw, people saying that you just walk around doing nothing didn't bother playing the game long enough for figure how to actually hunt the animals.

It is indeed what HS (and MTG, YGO, online) should be. If you play for a while you get heaps of free packs and cards so you don't necessarily need to spend any money on the game. I stress how good the mechanics and lack of RNG is in this game. Yes, you do sometimes get mana screwed but that is simply part of the game. I would like to see an in-game tournament function",1

13626,"This game was released 4 months ago.It's beautiful whilst so young. This is no minecraft clone. Minecraft was all pixels and blocks. This game has blocks as well as round player models, round creatures, round plants with their typical real life shapes. The blocks aren't pixels at all, oh no. You can identify grain on wood, leaves in leaf blocks.My first impression was literally ""Wow, this game is...so pretty!""Gameplay is smooth, lag is minimal, multiplayer is instant (doesn't need lots of time to set up) and gameplay with friends is simple and enjoyable.Minecraft felt, well, boring. I don't know what there is to this game. The graphics are immersive, and stunning for such a simple game. Mechanics are similar, but the game didn't quite sit on the same shelf as Minecraft. A friend told me there's even lore!I don't know, I'm just in love with the game. There is no 'PayToWin'. The only purchases which you can make which might mean something are blueprints for building pre-made structures.But free building is much more enjoyable, and free. Such a great game. I utterly hope it stays so. <3",1

3550,"Early Access ReviewI've seen quite a lot of reports about this game destroying your Windows install, or being a Trojan...I mean, I know it logs a ♥♥♥♥♥on of data, like all Tencent games anyway... But Tencent games themselves aren't the only ones that do this.Let's talk about all the other games running EasyAntiCheat and BattlEye, which both CONSTANTLY SCAN your system to check if there are cheats running in the background, or if there are bad libraries dropped inside the game's folder using a fake name (e.g. d3d9.dll)... Or even VAC itself from Valve, which scans all the incoming and outgoing Internet traffic!Going back to the Trojan thing, I've tried running this on both my fast desktop and my old laptop, and they both still work fine, nothing broke or something like that... So I really don't know what's happening to you guys.So here's my verdict:If you don't like handing your data to Xi Jinping, then DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME I guess.If you don't give a damn, and you already know that this game is doing the same exact thing as other games, and most companies such as Facebook and Google, then go ahead and play it, it's pretty fun.P.S.

It's sad when you either have to find a community server that I get near 250 ping or play bot matches just to entertain myself playing this game. I can't honestly recommend that anyone plays this unless valve fixes the horrible mistake that mym was. And I don't mean ""fix"" it by just polishing competitive and casual. here is a list of some of the big things valve needs to fix1. Get rid of casual2. bring back vanilla pubs3. new weopens NOT reskins4. buff the heavy not the pyro5. stop trying to be overwatch6. fix competitive and make it playable7.

9593,"Changed my mind this game sucks, Thumbs Down now. You can still read the review if you want.Alright so It looks like that i'm the only one here now with an insane amount of hours that still actually thinks this is a good game, not entirely ruined by the company. This is a game where if you play a lot you're going to be good. If you play a lot you're going to get good gear. It's not as if the company Kabam being greedy is taking the core away from the game, just because Kabam is a greedy company it shouldnt take away from the fact that you can still enjoy the game without paying a lot of money.If you come into a F2P game and expect to not spend any money then you were mistaken to even set foot in it in the first place because you all know as well as I do what the F2P business model is.There are a lot of things that which you must buy to fully enjoy the game for what it is, but like I said that should be expected for most F2P games today. You may need vault chests, which is 500 Gold each which equals 5USD. You may need a character slot, which the first few are cheap but the rest cost about 1000 gold, which equals 10USD. But you do not need to buy all of these seperartely, they do frequently release GOOD packs that allow you to actually save on some money if you wait for one of them, for example the play more pack can have 1 character slot 1 vault and 2 backpacks, which is a 2000 gold value for only 1000 gold.So if you decide you want to play this game then give it a shot but do not expect to not pay anything if you plan on playing it a lot.Now I will say that even I am not the happiest with Kabam, they're very sloppy, greedy, and slow with content. But that does not make this a bad game. I repeat for the 50th time that does not make this a bad game. I just makes a game that is ran by a bad company. Everyone here downvoting this game because of the company is just wrong because you cant judge the game itself like that, you're taking away from other people who may geniuenly enjoy this game for what it is, because you gave it a bad review when it doesnt deserve it. I am by no means a kabam fanboy. But I am a RotMG fan, and If you're looking to play this game then I do reccommend it.",0

11434,Early Access ReviewThe game is great. But the downfal to this game is the Aim hackers. Black Squad Devs thrive on these people and support their efforts. They will not allow us to report them.  With that said for a free game yeah its fine but the people who own this game give a rats azz about their player community.  Everyting in their shop is way too much so if you want to have all the cool toys you have to pay. I do think it is worth trying as the game and controls are great. I just truly hope the developers crack down on the hacks.,1
11224,"Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewIt may say that I currently have less than 100 hours of playtime as of the posting of this review but rest assured that if it accumulates the hours I put in on mobile... well, let's get on with it.It seems to have some of the basic concepts of Magic: Attack phase occurs simultaneously for all attackers, summoning sickness(Only affect attackers and not tap abilities), you can assign blockers or let them hit you(Unlike some others where you can target whatever you like so long as it doesn't redirect your attack), fast spells(Instants) and 5 colours. That's where the similarities end.Pros:1. Multiple game modes, gauntlet to test your deck against AI opponents to grind gold or if you have unstable connection, forge, soft of draft-like mode against AI again, casual play, ranked play and even a unique drafting mode! Direwolf Digital is active in being creative with the game and there are multiple events held to keep one entertained. 2. Completely newbie-friendly, complete the campaign to learn the basics of the game and play to get deeper and learn multiple tactics. For card game veterans or people coming from MTG, you should feel right at home with this game.3. RNG. RNG is quite generous in this game, you have high chances of pulling a legendary from a pack or if you have cash to spare, buy a box to support the devs and get guaranteed legendaries! Of course, you'll get a guaranteed rare per pack which is quite good as you can dissolve duplicates for shiftstone to craft other cards.4. Randomness. Sure there are meta decks but the randomness is what makes it fun. Meme decks? Check. Home brew? Check. Whacky deck that people say will never make it in ranked but somehow boosts you up the ladder? Check. The sky and your creativity are the limit(That and shiftstone).5. Active fanbase and discord server. They're ready to help you whenever you want or need it. This also means tournaments you can take part in as you get familiarised with and good at Eternal.Cons:1. Randomness. This may be fun but not much when the rng is against you. Drawing a good hand or a good card when you need it is less likely than say, obtaining a legendary from cracking a single pack. Some draws are ridiculous and mulligans don't help much. You might get power-flooded or colour-screwed due to the game's drawing mechanism. However with the update of 2-4 sigils after mulligan, it helped, not much, but still helped a little.2. The timer reset. As with every game, there are bad sports, salty players or plain sore losers. The fact that the timer resets every time after they delay is a hassle. Problem is not really with the timer as people who run control decks may be forced to rush if so, but with these sort of players wasting time and ruining the experience. Not really a fault with the game or company, just the player base.Overall a pretty good and unique card game. May even be a solid contender for mtg with what it's doing right now if not for the loyal fanbase over for WOTC. Solid 4/5",1

Apparently I have to go through the worst menus ever to equip it. Thanks for not telling me, game.This game tries to be a mix of COD and CS but flops overall. Maybe I'll try it again when the menus aren't terrible.Edit: I played the game again and holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, the grenade spam is terrible. Also I noticed that there are 2 maps for TDM.

2299,"Do you like action rpgs?Do you feel that Diablo III is too dumped down, you enjoy the gameplay and setting but only for a few weeks at a time...Well then you should give this game a try for sure.It's a worthy spiritual successor to Diablo II imho; A unique lore/setting, deep character building options and a vibrant and active community.A few things you should know before diving in:- The game survives by virtue of mirotransactions. BUT it is NOT pay-to-win. - Microtransations are mostly consmetics, but a few quality of life features can be bought as well (stach tabs etc.)- The skill system is a bit different than you might be used to. Skills are obtained by getting skillgems which needs to be socketed into your gear. A tad confusing at first, but the system is solid when you get the hang of it.- A deep (and at first somewhat confusing) passive skill tree is what makes your character feel unique. With over 100+ points you can put into a tree, a lot of builds can be made.Anyways I would suggest you give the game a try and if you like it buy a few stashtabs etc. to support GGG :)",1

In tanks you are cruising out looking for prey then suddenly you explode from and exploding ammo load or your crew is rendered unconscious!  So you spend money to get extra crew training points and to upgrade to ace crew and it makes little difference.There is nothing in the game to encourage team play, I play this with a few friends and its impossible to actually play with them.  Another player here refered to it as a complete free for all, he/she is 100% right.Hit aim indicators are pretty much useless, especially in tanks.  You get a green armor penetration marker, you fire a shot knowing that the round should land on a vulnerable location then all you get is ""no damage"" or a complete miss.  Drving a big♥♥♥♥♥tank through the woods you clip a tree then your tank track breaks -.-  are they made from used condoms and tissue paper?  Vehicle models for ground forces are absolutly nuts.  Russian vehicles are OP, game developer is russian, nuff said.Historically the game is way off, if you spend the time and do your research on vehicles you will see what I am talking about.  Now look at both positive and negative reviews!  Positive reviews are for the vast majority from people with very little playtime and only a few sentences long.  Negative reviews from players with HUGE play time and the majority of them are quit long and descript.  I have spent a long time reading the negative reviews, I agree with them all.  1.37 destroyed the game in favor of capitalism.  1.39 did little to rectify anything.Moderators and support in general is TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE, I actually got chastised by support staff in my last two tickets even though they where acurrate, polite and somewhat complimentary!  The support staff for this game need public execution and mature experienced support persons to take the reigns.Short of it is:  The game is terrible, when you have a problem expect little in the way of help, once you get into a teir 3 vehicle you will just get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over making progression nearly impossible.

7039,"This is basically a Hearthstone rip off will Elder Scrolls lore. That doesn't mean it's bad though. Listing the pros:Elder Scrolls: Legends allows more freedom when it comes to deck building, no need to restrict yourself to 30, instead, you can have a max of 70 cards if you want. The art is really nice, and the plethora of cards you can make and get equal nearly unlimited deck building.Thats mostly where my compliments for this game ends.This game is NOT heavy on PTW in my opinion, however, it is highly RNG based. You play a 10 minute game, successfully put up guards, lethals, charges, (those are types of cards) whatever you may want, only to go from about 25 to 30 health to 0 to -10 in a matter of 2 turns. People in this game either play extremely defensively to the point that you're fighting an indestructable turtle, or they play hyper aggressive with lethals and ""vampire"" cards.Now that I got the salt out of my system from losing 4 consecutive matches with a strength/willpower deck to a bunch of agility/endurance decks (good luck beating them), this game is all and all basically just Hearthstone with more depth and more freedom. If you like that, play it.Oh and this game is free, which is nice.",1

I like the new mechanics, and the style choices of this game. If I could change anything, I feel at some parts it's too fast for me to read what certain cards do to see whats going on, and I wish there was a play history on the side (or a more obvious one, because I haven't noticed one) I also feel like the AI could be more challenging. I felt like some wins weren't earned, and it was just a stall point to the next opponent, one deck didn't play a single monster, just stuck with spells to give them more power until I won. (I am obviously newer to this game, but I noticed I do level up in the gauntlet, so that might change in the future)Other than that, I enjoy this and hope to see it succeed.",1

For anyone that loves to get endless loot and strive to become one of the most powerful players, this game is for you. But there's a small problem. This game is entirely a money run. I don't think I've ever seen a game that is more pay2win than this one. You can literally buy yourself to being some of the most powerful players in the game, despite all those players that choose not to spend any money. Most people who say this game isn't pay2win are people who have spent hundreds of dollars themselves, choosing to deny their own waste of money. For anyone that still thinks this game isn't controllable with money, look at the ""shop"". You can buy all classes, infinite ""gem dust"", and anything else you need to become maxed out.

3843,"This game is fascinating. I remember I tried playing it a year ago but I sucked♥♥♥♥♥ so I gave up on it, even though I played for about fifteen minutes. I tried it again this year, because I read the reviews and everyone seemed so fascinated, claiming the game ruined your life because it completely consumed you, some people going as far as saying that something as simple as the whole hats deal was addictive. I'd laugh it off, thinking ""It can't be that bad"".After almost two months of playing, I can confirm; yeah, it's that bad. Perhaps worse.The first few weeks the liking was soft, I liked the game, the ""Meet the"" videos were amusing and really drew me to the game, but I was extremely bad at first, ""15 kills, 10 deaths"" type of bad. I dominated just one player every two rounds; and I even got really excited when I got a revenge (Jesus, it's embarrassing to admit). That's how bad, and even n00by I was. I was coming back to online PC gaming after six years of sticking to console, so that wasn't helping. But then, when I started playing a little bit more... when it was a domination after domination, when I'd become friends with my pocket Medics or the people I was a pocket Medic to... Life changed. This game literally consumed me. I wanted to use a portion of my birthday money to buy myself some cosmetics *just* for my Medic, make him beautiful ya'kno, and I ended up spending all of it in cosmetics for many of the classes. I'd stay up extremely late at night playing, sleep little, to then wake up early to play again. Now it's gotten to the point in which I've played 12 hours straight of TF2 with little rest in-between, two days ago it was *fourteen* hours. With a lot of effort I got up my♥♥♥♥♥♥to work out today just to not be too sedentary, and it was exasperating because I wanted to play. The game's just special like that, ya'know? It's fun. It's unique, creative. And I love the small details like the angry faces the classes make when they're shooting or fighting, the happy faces on the partner-taunts, the faces of agony when they're with low health; details like that make it special. And it's just generally very addictive.My point? This game is f*cking terrible. I don't give a cr*p if it's free, DON'T INSTALL IT. IT WILL CONSUME YOU AND RUIN YOU. F*CKING RUN.

I was pleasantly surprised to have a gun range to test the beginner rifle I was given, and after getting used to the aiming set out with a cool PDA and deer call. After tracking down some deer I landed a shot, then followed the trail of the fleeing deer to the carcass. Having no experience with hunting, either virtual or in real life, I have to say hunting the deer was pretty fun.I quit the hunt, then loaded back in, intent on hunting the other animal I was told my guest membership allowed me to kill, cottontail rabbits. After tracking one down, I shot it, only to be informed that the rifle I was using was not the proper caliber.I looked my inventory and confirmed that I had only the single rifle.With trepidation, I checked the store, and confirmed my fears; this game is absolutely rife with microtransactions that stain the entire genre. I'm shocked they didn't include an energy system, because they charge for just about every item or action you might want to do.Want to hunt anything more than deer with anything other than the default rife?Everything, from weapons to a box of ammo to equipment to hunting liscenses costs real money, at least $5 a pop.It's a shame the developers felt gouging their customers was the only way to make money, because there's a legitimately interesting game underneath the ""free to play"" filth.",0

14885,"Early Access ReviewThe game used to be good. Trust me, you don't want to play. I've been keeping up with the patchnotes and some other stuff relating to it, only because I'm too lazy to unfollow them on Facebook. The patches seem to be following the pattern I saw in the days leading up to my departure from the playerbase about a year ago. I've noticed their desperate attempts to add band-aid ""features"" and ""balances"" that are meant to appease their ""fans"" and keep them around and have them pay 2 win. The DLCs aren't worth their cost at all, $35 dollars for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ flyer that won't last 5 seconds in a match? LMAO!! and $50 for premium? WTF?!?!? At most its worth $10! AT MOST!I've sunk so many hours into this game because, once upon a time, it was a good game. And then they slipped on the stairs and fell down into the depths of Hell itself. How? idk. Supposedly, at some point, Freejam was in major debt to its parent company, and so they introduced the crate system as a way to convice players to buy crates and premium in order to pay off their parent company. Since they are still around, it seems like that worked, even though it shouldn't have. The crate system is literally a festering cancer, as they add new items (that are cancer to use) the reward pool grows, decreasing your chances of getting anything decent. Then again, the drop rates were rigged in a way that very rarely did something decent drop, and it was most likely in the premium row of items, so you needed to be feeding them money in order to get it. Premium was never worth the price. In the early days, all it did was double your currency income, which meant that you could sealclub all the newbies. As a newbie back then, I can say that sealclubbing was a very common occurence, it took me 6 months thanks to that to actually get to the mid tiers. After a while, they added colors so that you could color your bots however you wanted. And of course, there was a catch, you needed premium to get more than 3 colors; white, an ugly sky blue, and an ugly off orange. And after crates, you needed premium to get decent items, or in most cases, more items to sell, at what felt like pawnshops, to save up your pennies for that badass weapon that is the current meta. But thanks to the pawnshop-like selling, it would take you literally years to save up enough to get 1 of that item, let alone the 3 or 4 you'd need for it to be viable. And by that time, the devs would have initiated at least 4000 different metas. In the early days, everything was relatively balanced. Of course there were ways to exploit it, but it wasn't that bad. After a while, the game became extremely unbalanced (addition of new movement types and/or weapons). So, they did some quick patches to ""fix that."" R.I.P. balance, that set the game into a death spiral of cancerous metas. While that may sound bad on paper, its far worse in reality; worse than a plane spiraling to the ground while its tail section and one of its wings fall silently beside it. There were the over-tiered tanks, tanks built with low-tier armour and equipped with guns from many tiers above the armour (possible because of the way your bot's tier was determined). So, slap some tier 2 armor on, then slap some tier 7 guns on, go rek the tier 4 people, ggez. But tiers were removed, so good bye over-tiering. Then came the flak cannons, RIP flyers of all kinds. Then came rockets, RIP everything. Then came the hovers with the tiny corner triangles (I forget what they were actually called), which zipped around in the sky being invisible and obliterating everything. Then came the ultra tanky mechs, absorb all the damage, and destroy everything. Then came the shotguns. Then came the tiny, cloaked, tesla (melee basically) bots. After that I left, no surprise really. I'm sure there's been even more cancerous metas since I left too, sad thing is, there's probably more than I think (which is saying something, cause I think its a ♥♥♥♥ ton). There's always been building restrictions, you have never been able to build what you want. Its sad really, because there's so much potential in the concept. You want to know the saddest part of the entire popularity of this game? Even THE most popular Robocraft Youtuber, Rosefall, left because he got fed up with how much the game had drifted from its good 'ole days. Rosefall has moved on to bigger and better things, you can search up his channel if you want to see what happened for yourself. Really the only remaining popular Robocraft Youtubers are Gromek999 and Jac733. I can only assume that they are paid by Freejam to continue making videos that shed a positive light on this game, I don't know how anyone could make a positive video on Robocraft anymore, even if they were paid. They could pay me $10mil a video and I still would refuse to brainwash the uneducated young into wasting their lives and their parents' money on such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. In conclusion, don't waste a single second on this game. But even more importantly, don't spend a single penny on this game, Freejam doesn't deserve your money.",0

5098,"Early Access ReviewI had some doubts about this when I saw it on steam, but I tried it at PAX east and it was actually a lot of fun. For the high price of free I picked it up.The gameplay is good--the controls are responsive, but much better with a controller (the flying item-grab and the dodge are much easier if you have shoulder buttons, it can win you a lot of games). There's a strong emphasis on aerial movement, more than Smash--pretty much if you don't get knocked out, you can make it back with multi-jumps, dodges and wall jumps. The characters are interesting, although some are more interesting than others.The first thing that kind of got me down about the game was the high gold cost of character unlocks--you get a small amount of gold for completing matches (whether you win or not), and a slightly larger pot doing ""Quests"" a la Blizzard, you get one per day and can bank a couple if you log on. You also get some gold for just logging on. The downside is, it worked out to be about a week of playing casually to unlock a single bottom-tier character. The gold cost is very high--probably a couple of weeks for a high-level character with a few games per night, despite a lot of the online player base assuring people ""Oh you can unlock them all by playing, it's not bad."" Real talk, it's kind of rough.The devs soften the blow a little by having a rolling roster of heroes weekly, so even noobs get to play as everyone eventually. But it's a good game, it's been a hit at parties, and I respect the devs for living up to ""Early Access"" and releasing new characters semi-regularly, so I ponied up the cash during summer sale and bought the character pack--basically, turning it from a slow grind into a full-game.Unfortunately, you can't buy skins or weapons or anything without over-priced ""Mammoth Coins"" (each new skin comes out to an excessive couple of bucks, with no option to buy with in-game currency), so if you buy the game straight up like I did and need no more characters, you really have very little use for gold anymore. Just recently they added seasonal colors that you could buy in the store, giving me a reason to check back in--I guess me and the devs were on the same page about that.The devs have made a good game, and I really like the skins--but they are so prohibitively expensive I can't justify spending the money on them. I'm glad they have put some stuff, even minor though it is, up for gold in the store though--it gives me something to work towards again.EDIT: Devs released more content which addressed one my main reasons for not recommending.",1

I told them that I could have just spent that time working overtime at my job and probably had enough money to buy every single premium item they had for sale.They pretty much told me I could F off, that the contest was working as intended.I told them that the high level of customer service I had recieved was leading me to uninstall the game and never play again.

In the begining War Thunder showed so much promise and seemed like it could be genuinely fun without absurd grind or pay to win nonsense, and for a while it really was. But as the years have gone by systems changed to make the grind worse, more and more pay to win BS was added and the devs have made it more and more readily apparent that they don't care about their consumers, only making as much money as possible off of us. Pile on the recent friction between the developers and the community and it is apparent to me that War Thunder is no longer worth supporting in any way, not with my money and not with my time as a player, so it is with a heavy heart that I have to say good bye to War Thunder for good.",0
10236,"I have played this game for more than 1000 hours, just not through steam. The game is beautiful and probably the best hunting simulator you'll come across for a very long time. Some new players won't enjoy it because they don't realize that the game is not meant to be played as COD or Battlefield, and you'll have a hard time getting alot of harvests if you sprint around with your rifle when trying to find animals.The biggest problem for new players though, is the awful payment model. You need to buy membership or licenses to be able to hunt all the animals, which costs real money. You also have to buy in-game currency to buy new weapons through the store, which is the only way you'll to be able to take ethical shots on all species. You can buy membership packages (bundles) which comes with discounted weapons and equipment, but it won't take long before you wish you had more callers, camos, tents, weapons, you name it, even if you bought the 1year membership bundle. There are alot of items in the game, and pretty much all of it will cost you real money, aswell as being somewhat expensive compared to most other F2P games.All this taken into consideration, I still love the game, simply because I feel the gameplay is worth the money you need to spend on it to enjoy it. If you are looking for a good hunting simulator, this is your game, but you will have to be willing to spend quite a bit of money on it to be able to enjoy it to it's full potential. If you are just looking for a F2P time-waster, then this game is very likely not something you want to spend much time on. ",1
9892,"Elsword is an amazing game. The level up system is very indepth and highly customizable. The game offers tons of content even after you have caught up with everyone else in terms of story, and new content is added every so often to keep the story flowing. Just recently, they added cutscenes during dungeon runs to help move the story along even more. All in all, I say that the game is worth picking up.",1
10108,"Played the game for an hour with my friend we had a really good time and really enjoyed stalking this one damn deer across the expanse of the map. Came back to it the following week to find something new to get told that we needed to pay membership to now play with each other. Considering this is a free to play game, and yes I accept they need to make money somehow, to make it a free to play single player is rather rediculous considering the attraction is with the multiplayer and co-op aspect. Really dissappointing. Actual gameplay is fun with a friend where you can keep eachother amused, but for this game to be fun you need that and I don't expect to have to pay to have fun.",0

It's great that you have control over this. Love the fact that you have to look for the materials you need to be able to craft your items, and one thing that got me hooked is how positive the fans are in this community, and especially how fun, creative, and interactive the devs are!

13952,This game could be good I am not sure cause I died on a PVE Beginner server at the hands of another player. The UI main landing page is very busy with news and featured modules crammed in next to your character information. In all honesty that can be removed since both news and featured has their space in the nav bar. The play button in the upper right hand corner can be overlooked easily and does not draw your eye to quickly.  Music volume slider should preview how the new change before you apply it.I hate that when you die once the timer runs out you have to click revive. It should automatically update once the timer runs out to avoid using the button.,0
11437,"Early Access ReviewPreviously gave a negative review, staff responded and I removed it to give them the benefit of the doubt.2 months later, including tickets sent to the admins with video link proof of hackers, yet still no action taken.This game is not P2W but it's definately a place for FPS hackers to play. That is, unless you are willing to pay for the hack itself.Doubt I will come back again, as Black Squad has lost my trust in providing a fair and competitive gameplay for players.Regards,Melvin",0
6725,"The game devs awkwardly try to balance realism with an arcade-style shooter, and the result is a game which while fun initially has increasingly strayed from anything that could be considered enjoyable. This is not helped by the fact that most of their design decisions seem to be based around making as much money as possible, a not uncommon reality with free to play games. Rather than fix bugs or ridiculous game mechanics (like people being able to jump off of speeding motorcycles and accurately shoot a bazooka within the span of two seconds, or the ability to teleport into and out of vehicles, dodging bullets in the process) they simply try to add more customization, more guns, more ribbons - fluff that adds no value to the game but lines their pockets with cash. That, and making the amount of time it takes to grind to get good weapons ever longer, an effort to encourage people to spend money on ribbon boosters and veteran membership.This game's simply becoming their cash cow. If you want to find a fun World War II shooter it's best to look elsewhere, rather than braving the months it would take to grind up to a reasonable level to be competitive in this one.",0

3616,"I've split up this review into different fractions to make reading easier.IntroductionTeam Fortress 2 is a free to play, class-based multiplayer FPS.This means that the game has classes, which differ from each other with their skills, mobility, health and weapons.Team Fortress 2 is mainly based around team-based gameplay, introducing older and newer-styled game modes, mainly from classic FPS games like Quake and Unreal Tournament.Game ModesOver the years the game has been filled with lots of different game modes with different objectives. The current amount of Game modes is 19. I'm not going to list every one of them, but i've picked couple intriguing ones:Capture the Flag (CTF): A game mode where the objective is to Capture a Flag from the other team's base, and carry it to your own base.Control Points (CP): A game mode where other team is attacking, and the other is defending. The objective is either capture all the points (by standing on the point for few seconds) or defend them for being captured.King of the Hill (KOTH): A game mode where there is a capture point in the middle of the map. The team which stands on the point for the longest, wins.Classes and Their PersonalitiesThe game has 9 different classes divided into 3 categories (Offensive, Defensive & Support.)If you're a Lore Lover (like me), there's a lot of lore and backstories from the characters. They're not very visible through the game, but they can be found in the shape of comics and animated short films at Team Fortress 2's youtube and their official website.Offensive: Scout, a fast and eager boy from boston with an ability to double jump. Soldier, a crazed american patriot with an ability to Rocket Jump. Pyro, a flamethrower-wielding maniac with a mysterious past.Defensive: Demoman, drunk irishman specialized into explosives. Heavy(-weapons guy), a very slow but large russian man, who favors the use of minigun. Engineer, an intelligent texan who uses Turret to secure passages and areas.Support: Medic, a mad doctor specialized in healing. Sniper, an australian who takes out targets from a great distance. And last, but not least: Spy, a cunning frenchman using disguises to fool enemies and then backstab them.Mobility and MovementThe game brings back Rocket Jumping, a type of movement used in series of games like Quake & Unreal Tournament.Using a Rocket Launcher and shooting against your own feet, you can push yourself into great hights.Strafing, a type of movement where you move to right or left in-game, whilst horizontally moving your mouse.Combining Strafing and Rocket Jumping, you can travel large distances with incredible amounts of speed. However, this requires lots of training and precise timing.Cosmetic Items and TradingAt March 18th, 2010, the first few cosmetic items were added to the game. After many years few have turned into dozens, and dozens into hundreds. These items can also be painted, making them more customizable and fun to use.You can customize your character to your liking, and be almost anything you desire; a Samurai, a Gangster, even the Batman. Who wouldn't love to be the Batman?Trading got added to the game at August 9th, 2011, when Steam trading beta got introduced.CommunityTo be honest, the only thing why i think this game is still alive after over 10 years, is it's active community.When taking a look at Team Fortress 2's Community Workshop, countless maps, cosmetic items and different types of weapons can immediately be noticed. Despite of the game being as old as it is, the loving community keeps pumping more blood into the heart of Team Fortress. Charity events and competitive tournaments are still being held.Developers and the Current State of the GameIt's sad how the Developer Team has withered into the mere point of extinction over time.Despite of the community being unimaginably active, it still needs the devs to push out the updates.For comparison:On years 2008-2010, the game got 14 major updates, bringing new game modes, maps, cosmetic items and new weapons.On years 2011-2013, the game got 14 major updates, bringing even more game modes, maps, cosmetic items and new weapons. Killstreak weapons were introduced.On years 2014-2016, the game got 11 major updates, bringing couple game modes, few maps, cosmetic items and no new weapons. Weapon skins were introduced.On years 2017-present, the game got 1 major update. Reworking 1 class, bringing few maps, cosmetic items and 4 new weapons (for 1 class.)From this comparison we can clearly see how infrequently the game is updated nowadays. This has made many people quit off and move on to other games, games which are still taken care of.ConclusionTeam Fortress 2 used to be a game full of life and joy. But it's golden days are over.The game is updated rarely, and gets easily boring without good friends to play with.The game is worth trying, but i wouldn't expect too much from it.It was really hard for me to choose if i would recommend this game or not.Despite of it being my favorite game for many years, i think it's just not worth it anymore.Years ago, i would've recommended Team Fortress 2, but now i think it has just lost it's shine.",0
1570,Early Access ReviewI've played the game aliitle nit i thought it was better good. but i haven't played in awhile because for some reason i get screen tear out the♥♥♥♥♥and there's no vsync which i dont understand why there isn't if someone knows o=how to fix the screen tear plz message me.,1
10830,"Early Access ReviewWhat a great game! I played extensively in the closed beta and it never got old. Comparisons with Hearthstone and Magic are inevitable and its fair to say that this game has taken the best of both, but it stands on its own as well as a fresh and unique experience. Give it a go!",1
3376,"Early Access ReviewThis game is, as a lot of people put it, PUBG but better in literally every way.  This review will mostly compare it to PUBG, sol people who already play it and other games like Fortnite/H1Z1 can know exactly how this is better and what's different/new to expect that you won't find in other battle royales. Note that I've only got a few hours of game time but I've got dozens more on the beta summer map. Pros:- It's free, you have literally zero excuse not to at least try it- Weapons are better, attachments go onto your guns automatically and should you change weapons, the old attachments will automatically transfer to the new ones. More balance, no more instakill shotgunning people across the map.- Only one map so far but it'll soon beat PUBG in this as well with 2 other maps planned, one most likely being the ""old"" beta map. Everyone complaining about the new map should understand that the old one will come back when it's ready.- New ""Classes"" for the winter map: Snowboarder can travel quickly downhill, glider can travel far distances quickly, and rock climber can climb mountains and travel around rather easily through predetermined ziplines that go both uphill and downhill. I imagine summer map and map 3 will have their own classes as well.- Spawn points. Rather than jumping out of a plane, you pick exactly which point on the map you wish to spawn at and are teleported there instantly at the start of the match. This also offers you an opportunity to know where everyone else spawns, and how worried to be about player activity in your spawn area. You can spawn away from everyone else for worry-free farming, or drop straight into a hot zone and rush the best loot.- Rather than a ""Barrier"" of some sort that closes in slowly in pretty much every other BR, this time (At least on winter map) the permafrost replaces a barrier, and it shows up instantly when the timer goes to 0. The frost will progressively hurt more as the temperatures drop.- The winning condition. Once the frost has almost envelopped the entire map, a rescue helicopter swoops in to rescue up to 4 individual survivors, or an entire 4 man squad. Anyone who makes it to the chopper to get those four seats wins, and by this point there's usually 8-10 people left so it's quite a battle to climb on without someone shooting you. This does, however, allow for more than one winner in almost every case. Some people will like this mechanic, some will not, but it's original and a good concept.- All the big cities have ""lore"" in almost every second house in the form of newspapers and journals, giving you a little insight into the map itself when you've got some free explore time. Cons: What are those? Besides some bug fixing, this game has none. Graphics are nice, music is nice, gameplay is nice, it's all around a solid game that teabags every other BR on the market. The only real con is that every other BR game is going to have to adopt a f2p model or go extinct thanks to this jewel appearing at the small price of 0$ for everyone.Other thoughts: The ice pick class is just straight up OP, you have absolutely no reason to pick the other two classes when this class exists. Not only do you have increased carry capacity, but your mobility is insane. You also don't need to be at the top of a hill to use this class, as ziplines go both ways and are all over the place. My suggestion to the devs would be to either make ziplines usable by all classes, or make ice picks given to everyone with the other two as extra choices. Alternatively, for balance you can add more ski-lifts and only allow snowboarder class to use them. I can't think of a way to balance glider, as it's only really good for making one trip down a mountain to escape the frost and then it's useless for the rest of the game. Jumping off a 5 story building will get you 50 feet, you absolutely have to be at the top of a mountain to get any use out of it which also limits your potential strategic spawn locations. ",1

I still love it and in fact I play it more than DOTA 2, League of Legends, and Heroes of the Storm.  I just love the aspect and controls of this game more I love the idea of playing gods and how some of their kits are imagines and worked into the game.  No complaining about auto pathing here as you are in control of your character at all time unless your under some hard crowd control effects like: Being in the moth of Fenrir, Being Slapped by Poseidon's Kraken, or Being stunned by Artemis' Boar the list goes on.  I just really enjoy the game and what it's become it’s the most Action based moba I can think of without a top down camera. There is also Awesomenauts but that’s like a moba/ 2d platformer which is neat in its own right.If other Moba's have not piqued your interest with their top down perspective and possible micro managing. Smite throws all that out the window for a fast paced and third person perspective!Do I recommend SMITE? Yes. Just the fact you can earn premium cash (gems) in events and for logging in daily says a lot most games that are free to play don't let you earn the premium cash. Paladins does as well with daily log-ins but they are both Hi-Rez games.Give it a shot! Play gods most of which You probably never heard of Like the Mayan Pantheon. I never knew about a Chaac or a Xbalanque guy!? But more of what I like is how they made these gods their own unique characters! Seriously just try it it's free.",1

10510,"I found this game before it came to steam. I played it. I loved it.I continued to play this game throughout the summer of 2013.The main reason I loved this game was because of its community.the ages of people that play this range from 9 to 50. (just a guess)And you may be thinking ""9 year olds? what is this? Call Of Duty?"".No.The kids in this game are friendly and don't use rude language towards your family or culture.every one else is just as much fun to play with.You can even add friends and message them.That is what hooked me on this game.I made a few friends and we would hunt mule deer, rabbits, moose, etc. every day.The community isn't huge, but is also isn't dead.There are competitions happening 24/7, where hunters compete for the highest scoring animal hunted with specific weapons and in a specific location. winning one of these will award you with a trophie.There are also Leaderboards showing peope,with the longest shot to kill ""whatever the animal"", and highest scoring hunt of all time, etc..The game is incredibly beautiful, and you will often find yourself pulling out your camera (ingame) to take a photo and save it. The sounds of birds singing, and deers calling really make the wilderness scene come to life as you hunt for that mule deer buck.This is by far, the most realistic hunting sim out there.Not just because of the graphics or the ambience of the game, but the gameplay.Have you ever spent 6 hours in real time hunting down a deer in a video game? I have.This isn't just a ""sit down, play for 30 minutes and get off"" kind of game. Not even close.Grab a good book and get yourself a warm drink and wait. just wait in that tree stand 20+ feet off the ground.Wait. Wait. Wait.The only bad thing about this game is.. For free, you can only hunt mule deer. if you want to be allowed to hunt anything else, you must pay money. Before you run off thinking that this is a pay to win. just try the game. you get the full feel of the game by just hunting mule deer. If you like it, then put some money towards the game and have even more fun hunting larger and/or smaller game.My overall rating for TheHunter is. 8.5/10",1
12787,"it's not a bad game, it is qute fun and also hard to drive. over all i like itbutthe only promlem with it is it takes a good few minus to load? i mean a long time ie 3 mins or so. i guess it must be slow severs",0
12402,"Early Access ReviewAfter playing the game about 24h I have some thoughts and impressions about the game. The game itself has quite some potential. I dont mind all these bugs, laggs or even crashes. But what is most annoying are the incredible insanely queues when you want to log in. I startet at place 832 and after 142min I was place 4. I was happy that I could finally play but NO .. As soon as I passed place 1 I got an error and had to restart the game. Now Im at queue place 1443 and probably wont be able to play today at all..I DO NOT recommand the game in this stage. Its disgusting and just creates frustration. Play outside for the summer and try the game in fall or winter 2018 :P",0
7199,"Maybe if you have time to build a deck properly and level up you can enjoy this game, but as a game to kill 20 minutes here and there, it's no good. The enemies clearly cheat, and spam you with tons of low level cards. I had an enemy play two 4 level cards with zero magicka remaining and it was only a seven power turn with no ring. That was the final straw for me.Once you spend all of your cards you're completly open to attack, yet the enemy never seems to run out of cards.At least it was free so I can't complain too much, but I will be uninstalling.",0
7550,The fact that the game was free and I was actually able to play without buying anything was the reason I liked it. Now that you have to buy classes is just plain old stupid. Bad move Trove. Dont make a game free just to make it a pay to win game. Bad move Trove.,0
11089,Early Access ReviewOne of the best digital card games out there.  They took the good things about MTG and HS but added their own touch to create a easy to learn but hard to master card game.,1

While it can be a turn off for some the massive amount of keys and controls you have to learn just to get it a plane in the air it is also super rewarding when you knock out your first tank/plane.

I choose ftp first to see if i like it, then I chose pro and i love it. You can also make your own server and make it private for friends and you can make it public. You can claim land and make it so that anyone visiting is a vistor, or builder if they are trusted. Fun to play. great for the whole family. Create Create Create",1

1557,"Early Access ReviewI know i know... less than 3 hours played... clearly not enough time spent to fully appreciate this game.Oh, you just realized its EARLY ACCESS? moving right along...As of 3/4/15 this is what i think of the game:AwesomeOne map so far.A handful of ships to use, all different strengths, weaknesses, and skills. (Assassin class is my personal fav)Bots fill in empty spots on teams that are missing players, though they are NOT smart at all. You start shooting one and it will stop in place and only try to line up direct shots; making thier death that much easier. And the point difference between killing a player and a bot is marginal. You get around 40 more xp for killing a player.Graphics are wonderful. The deatail on the ships is well done. Turrets move with your cursor, thrusters fire off with movement (Small thrusters on different parts of the ship for turns), and damage to different hit locations are amazing. I.E. You take a bunch of damage to the engines, its starts to burn and spark. So far, no actual impedement of abililties/ movement from ship damage. Shading is well done. Its nice to be able to see an enemys' shadow on an asteroid before he cloaks, giving you at least an idea of where he is at.Sound is great. Voices are well done, for what they are in the current state of the game. Mostly little reminders of where enemies are attacking and such.Controls are ok. its nice to have different keys for up and down movement, but after playing any other space flight game it kind of seems a bit unneeded. just add mouse based movement (would be my best suggestion, with the add of cruise control that actually WORKS lmao). i dont know.. id be more used to it if i wasnt playing Star Conflict in the same day.Overall this game is a WIN. Do yourself a favor and buy this game and give out the free passes to your friends.heres to hoping they add parties/ groups :stein:",1
8018,"Free-to-play already gives complainers little to legitimately complain about. Level up relatively quick by accepting quest after quest and searching for quests or playing player-made quests when they stop getting blatantly forced upon you. Easy combat interface and locked down advancement trees make it hard to go awry. By the time you're level 15, you should be familiar with enough of the world's nuances to start to make your way with confidence. There is a lot to learn. Most frustrating is the learning curve concerning in-game monetary systems and earning methods. It's hard to figure out how to get money for many items you want, and several aspects of the game (including certain monies) are time-gated. You can speed up the process by paying for various services. My biggest complaint, however, would be loss of The Foundry (the in-game level design kit for players) as an active level design kit (and the primary award for reaching level 15). Thankfuly...user made content has returned as playable.",1
9831,"Much more Pay To Win than its predecessor Grand Chase. I don't have many hours into this game, but I had something like 1000 into Grand Chase, not counting the probably over 2000 I played off of steam. This game is very similar in most ways but with a sharp difference, Pay To Win. You have to buy Cash (Can't remember if its Cash or K-Ching) to get most of the good items. PvP has a salt level of over 9000, but I always found this entertaining rather than a drawback. Honestly, I wish they would have kept up Grand Chase and taken down Elsword, albiet its a newer game. Anyways, if you don't mind pouring money into the game, then sure it can be fun. But if you are looking for something you  can enjoy without spending a whole bunch then I would not reccomend this game.MORAL OF THE STORY, IF YOU CAME FROM GRAND CHASE I BELIEVE YOU WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED IN WHAT YOU FIND HERE.",0

2051,"Path of Exile successfully captures the spirit of older action RPGs and updates it for an experience that's as visually appealing as it's fun. The combat itself doesn't differ much from other examples in the genre, but Path of Exile distinguishes itself with a unique ability system based on gems and a labyrinthine passive skill system that permits the creation of almost any type of character. Leaderboards, PvP options, and lootable challenge maps spice up the higher level content, and an unusual bartering system staves off inflation in its multiplayer aspects. Best of all, it's free almost to a fault, revealing a compelling alternative path for free-to-play projects to come.",1
2968,"Yes, the game is really fun and addictive.  At 918+ hours I can say it is a true pay to win game.  I do not recommend this game unless you are willing to spend a couple hundred dollars or more on upgrades so you can at least have a fair chance against the other players who have  crews and or gear that can only be purchased with real money.  There is nothing wrong with using real money to buy stuff in a game but, when it comes to paying for XP so that you can lvl up your crews for the needed bonuses it adds up to a ♥♥♥♥ ton of nickel and dimes.  You will earn those same XP during each match, but at the rate of around 10 to 20 xp.  It takes several hundred if not thousands of xp to train one of around 25 skills (in Tank battles).  Good luck earning XP by just playing.  Long story short, this game sucks for PVP because of pay to win.  But is the best I have seen in a while for what I call eye candy (realistic looking models and FX)  and in single player mode, you can really take the time to enjoy what the game has to offer.PS.  I would accept War Thunder Gold Lion donations!  LoL",0

For those of you who enjoyed the web based game AdventureQuest, it will probably be a great MMO for you to reimmerse yourself into.But for people like me who prefer a more advanced or populated MMO, this is not for you. I couldn't get into it at all due to its mediocre graphics, the small and slowly growing player base, and the fact that it's just not exciting. As a personal preference, I would highly advise people to avoid this game. But feel free to make your own decision on the quality.",0
13602,Early Access ReviewWhile this game is great considering its beta i feel that onve you hit the corruption level the exploration stops and theres nothing left to do but build. I would very much like to see several more layers added to the world each with its own unique bioms and materials you need to harvest to get to the next level below. Other than that i would very much encourage you to pick this game up soley for the multiplayer aspects like the free servers saved to steam so you can play on a friends server without them being online.10/10 would grief my friends again,1
7575,"It kind of sucks now. Ya see, it used to be a nice little MMO for people who didn't want to pay much (like me). Then they made the classes things you had to buy. And they made it so if you wanted anything cool you had to either A: grind for it. B: Pay your money or C: Be really lucky. Not to mention that the combat system was never that great to begin with. There is literally only 1 upside, and that's the fact that the market is really easy to get rich off of. Basically, it used to be great but now it kind of sucks.",0

9804,"Elsword is a side-scrolling arcade style beat-em-up, the game shines in the different classes and unlocking new ablities.  they recently made leveling ALOT easier and you can get your final job advancement (2nd one) in 3-4 days unless your playing on a saturday or sunday.  The reason i say this is because Elsword has a stamina system that goes down whenever you kill monsters in the fields, or when a monster dies in a dungeon.  Stamina is reset every night and all character's have seperate stamina bars, so if you run out of stamina on one character, just switch to another.  Also the maximum characters per account (without buying any) has increased from 3 to i believe 6.  A problem is that there is no character cuztomization if you dont spend real money, and the job advancement clothes they give you only last up to 2 weeks before getting deleted.  This makes some characters (like chung in my opinion) look really stupid, most others look fine though.  some events have given out costumes but these are rare.  The combat is nice and fluid as you can chain abilities with combos, and there are about 16 abilities per character but you can only have four of them on your skill bar, you can sawp them but they only give you enough SP (skill points) to max out around 6 so choose wisely (at each advancement you get a free potion that givs you back all your SP).  For i think 10 dollars you can unlock 4 extra abilit slots for one character,  but most abilities take 100 mana and your max is 300 so this is not essential to beat dungeons.  dungeons are easy early on but they get harder to beat later in the game, the way they do this is kind of wierd.  Good healing consumables have to be bought or can be crafted with materials you get in dungeons (either way works) but after level 40 it becomes a struggle to stay alive.  its works like this, there are around 30 to maybe 50 enimes per entire dungeon after level 40, my one character has around 100k hp but a single enemy hit can hit me 1k to possibly 10k depending on what it is so killing enemies efficiently and not getting hit is the name of the game.  life items can be found in boxes in the dungeons but these are used upon touching them are not abundent enough to sustain you through the entire game, on top of that the only way to get revives are though field bosses (rare to get revives from them), events, or buying them with real money.  its hard to explain but PvP's are decieded by whoever can chain more combos with abilities without knocking down the opponent (this sorta goes for PvE to but on a lesser scale), unless your in a 3v3 match and have team mates to interrupt the combo (start playing the game and it will make more sense).  i have friends who i play with so i dont interact with the community that much but guilds are the way to go to socialize as dungeons are usually too crazy with all the fighting to type to each other.  last thing i would like to point out is any dungeon can be entered from anywhere and you can que for 4 player parties or just start instantly with whoever is in your party.  all in all the game has its cons but being a free to play game it is worth a try as they are adding new content on a fairly regualr bases. now if youll exscuse me my fingers hurt.",1

1453,"While I've only played about 2.7 hrs as of 20160927, the game has pulled me in quite a bit. I am not a fan of MOBAs but the title does a really good job at masking the MOBA concepts it adopts. 5v5 with two lanes, essentially, and an arena in the middle that opens up occasionally during battle. The team based combat doesn't feel too pushed but you can really feel the necessity when fighting against human players, as with most competitive MOBAs. Perhaps my favorite feature of the game is the F2P aspect. In essence, this is how ALL F2P titles should work. If you choose to spend money it does not give you an advantage over others as you're only unlocking the ships and crew members soonr as well as obtaining skins for ships. Overal this title is a must play, I mean come on it's free; what do you have to lose? Just uninstall it if you don't like it.",1

4614,"Since this is one of those reviews that show the complaints of a player who has spent infinite hours on said game reviewed, I must justify my intentions.The reason I criticize SMITE its because of its company, Hi-Rez, which I think has peaked its maximum level of disrespect for the community and greediness in their marketing. What hereby I'm going to give, is a definitive sentence on every game made by Hi-Rez, a silent agreement by many people on Reddit, Hi-Rez forums and critics alike: that the marketing has ruined what had once potential for being a solid game.Why now? Cause we confirmed suspicions about Hi-Rez thrice: with the bandwagoning of hot trends through the creation of Paladins Battlegrounds, Realm Royale and, of course, Medusa's (Smite's) Deathmatch.Smite, like every game of Hi-Rez, has always been a cheap (theoretically speaking) alternative to far more successful MOBAs, like League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm and Dota 2, even taking some of its designs with clever changes like Chernabog off Varus and Artemis off Windrunner.But the fact Hi-Rez has been inspired by its rivals is not the real problem. The problem is how Smite feels when played.Which translates to pure♥♥♥♥♥♥I will list the problems in the format of problem/reaction to highlight the attitude Hi-Rez has shown to its fanbaseProblem: Smite has always been plagued with too many bugs by a MOBA standard, more to the likes of a closed beta despite supposedly being a full game, with crashes, packet losses, FPS drops, client crashes, RAM overheatings and every variety of visual bug, especially on featured gamemodes, often followed by afk penalties despite being innocent.Reaction: Everything has been shrugged off, silently blamed it to the ones suffering and the problem persists since releaseProblem: The toxicity of the community, and you have my word, I play both LoL and DOTA 2 a lot, overwhelms the one of the two colossi put together, with afk at the fountain, intentional feeding, voice command spam, chilling toxicity with death threats and heavy insults. This is amplified to ridiculous levels when playing Conquest, apparently the Vietnam War due to the treatment to newcomers, which causes a vicious cycle of people not learning due to toxics and toxics insulting ""noobs"" because of people not being allowed to learn. Not to mention the hilarious (being sarcastic here) matchmaking that has yet to find a fix on any rank. Bronzes with Masters is a common antic by Hi-Rez.Reaction: Hi-Rez ignored these claims, never updated their report system, which is useless, unclear and non-functioning and many members in the forum have shown no empathy in the various forums. As such you can be as toxic as you want because you will never be retaliated against. This is a thing that is also abused through voice chats, which, should you be this stupid to play this game, I suggest to deactivate it in the option forever.Aside from those two problems, there are also intricate ones, like balance and marketing system.There is not an agreement about what criteria Smite uses to balance their game; however, there are many proofs of how many broken mechanics have been kept in and how released gods are always overpowered like the infamous cases of Bellona and Artio for champions, Hastened Fatalis and Frostbound Hammer for items or even skill parts which are simply ridiculous, like Bacchus' insane values despite being a Guardian, Odin's reworked Ring of Spears not having counters until last season or, more recently, Sobek's invincibility when using the ultimate.As for the marketing, Smite apparently seems to have gotten away with the lootbox method for cosmetics, which seems to be defended as right because they are cosmetics; meanwhile 80% of the skin are barred away from direct purchases and are locked inside lootboxes, with many, and much useless garbage items created and put ad-hoc, to lure the whales to spend lots of money, money which did not improve Hi-Rez braindead decisioning. The average is 60 items, and a ""roll"", cause it's gambling after all, is worthy 200 gems, the real money currency.PvE modes (Adventures) and skins are always the main focus. Smite wants you to grind endless hours or give in and pay incredibly expensive bundles which, in many cases they give only a small part and forced you to give more money, like the infamous Da Ji - Ratatoskr event. As for skins, you can bet they are going to give to mascots Neith and Bellona the most skins and will completely ignore most of the roster for them, leaving most gods with mediocre recolors and outdated crap or, in the case of Zhong Kui, almost no one despite the continue vexations by Reddit. Plus, there is the shameful fact patch live streams are made on Facebook and not on Twitch or Youtube and those for the 90% of the time elapsed are focused around skin while in the precious 10% of the time, god balance is talked about but the commentary is very stupid, hype-based and hints at a staggering ignorance of the commenters about how really those gods will feel like the nerf, buff or tweak.As for the gamemode availaibility, only an idiot would deny Hi-Rez has no regard of anything but their Conquest, also one of the main reason it feels like being in the Vietnam War, and keeping Arena and Joust just because the playerbase is already decaying. If by any chance, you like Clash or Siege, then you'll also know that Hi-Rez has projected to delete them. Aside from the obvious scream by them at you to play Conquest, with the events, which to further worsen the situations, are extremely costy, the skin, despite looking sparkling actually has♥♥♥♥♥♥particles and voice packs, and are locked behind many others with the same problems, the missions to complete them very often forced you to play Conquest and run into the problems I already listed, being the most CPU intensive. Hi-Rez free gems and favor gifting on login have always been a very good excuse to defend the game and a precious weapon of the company to make you illude yourself they are generous but when you consider what are these gems for, especially if you are F2P, you'll notice it's not really like that: but most importantly is the base of an old system taken by LoL which has been revamped completely and which DOTA 2 can't have since they have every hero, therefore making all of this an old attempt to give themselves good publicity. And aside from that, the grinding is really immense and the Founder Pack seems to be the only solution. As for the queue times, those often have problems of being delayed by an alarming case of people not accepting it, being even longer than LoL's and Dota 2 fused together.On the positive side, SMITE has done some noble things like the boosters and the level up bonuses, however, those are really suffocated when considering the massive amount of selfishness by Hi-Rez.Lastly, the advent of new games to catch up with the trends instead of fixing the already ill-fated games with even more grievous bugs in every new installment is the ultimate factor to the aforementioned ""sentence"".As such, this game does not retain anymore that addictive factor that once had and, with the leaving of Bart and Kelly, it's pretty much over.Dear reader, if you have red this far and you are undecided about whether to download this game or not, knowing how reverse psychology works, you are free to throw yourself in the bloodbath but, if you are willing to, follow a suggestion from someone who has wasted too many hours here: play another MOBA, there is no better one, everything is valid... but SMITE is simply garbage. Like Rust and Battlefront II, this game has insulted many players, paying or not paying. Save your time for games of higher quality.",0

17407,"-Looks like a PS2 game-Crashes on taming your first dragon sometimes. Crashes when there are too many players firing (Not sure how many is too many yet, this only happened to me once). Haven't encountered many crashes other than those.-Playerbase ranges from ~7-year-old children to +18. Not a good thing since there's a chat box. Heavy chat restrictions, but can be easily bypassed by adding x's or q's, or any other letter you wish in front of each word.-No real gameplay value past minigames, multiplayer races for trophy points, and ship battles for gems/eggs/saddles/etc. after finishing all of the quests.   (ship battles in a nutshell: hover dragon at the respawn area and spam f or fireball at ship for abt 2 mins, then wait 2 hours for the event, repeat)-You can't fight other dragons or trainers. Only in a quest where you fight the Red Death, which happens  once  in your viking's playthrough.-Toothless is the only dragon that's really satisfying to fly. (Members only)-Lots of dragons but not much use for them. Most of them are for show. (Boneknapper for example. Cool dragon, bad stats. Can't race, and there are better dragons for ship battles. The only two uses that a dragon can have, besides for looks. Races and battle events.)-Kind of a dragon collecting game because of the above. I've seen veteran players flex their entire collection of dragons on other players. That's pretty much all you can do with most of them.-Not only are most dragons essentially useless, but they cost gems! Which you're supposed to spend real money on!*I mean, if you like running and flying around interacting with people, this is a good game for that. Oh and quests. They run out after a while though. Can't replay them after that. Then you need to make a new viking.*Yeah, microtransactions suck, but the game doesn't have the best security against people who want to exploit the game. It was especially bad in 2015 or so. Anyone could get infinite gems. 2 years later, there are still exploits that need to be fixed.*Overall a decent game if you like collecting dragons and flying them around, and are willing to deal with getting gems for them. Just don't buy gems though, only try membership if you're thinking about it. I play this game to decompress. It's not that fast paced.*I would not recommend SoD to a friend to play a game. It's more about the social aspects than playing a game. You would likely have more fun interacting with people than racing or doing battle events. However, SoD isn't the only place you can talk to people, so that doesn't make  this particular  game stand out much.*I'd like to see more gameplay added in, like other dueling options than fireball frenzy, or another use for dragons like the boneknapper. He's average with speed and firepower, but he has a lot of armor and spikes. Maybe there can be a new minigame where bulky dragons can destroy things with melee attacks.*They're starting to improve the graphics in some areas, like the Training Grounds and the School, which is nice :) The water at the School is honestly the best looking part of the game.Graphics: 4/10Gameplay: 4/10Fun factor: 4/10Gets boring after a while. I log on every once in a while to fly around, then log off. Flight is one of those mechanics in games that are kind of hard to come by, especially if it's both free flight and it's an integral part of the game. To compare with MMORPGs like Riders of Icarus and World of Warcraft, these two games are just overdone and too detailed. I like School of Dragons because of its simplicity and focus on the dragons. It also isn't an eyesore for me, compared to RoI or WoW. There's just a lack of content in-game.  More things to do than quests, battle events, and races would be a good place to start working.  ",0

Having started post-Loot update i was faced with a constant part shortage that forced me to sell anything i didnt use just to scrape up enough money for a few decent weapons. I heard what the game used to be and it sounded alot better than the pay-2-win it is now. I honestly do not know why they even bother to get this game to wear it runs well on mid-lower machines because it is so pay to win now id rather just spend the money on my computer and play other high hardware demand games because this game just is not worth even trying to invest in.

But, In order to get most things in the shop, you have to use currency you can only use real money to get. It's not even an unfair system like this:Shirt: 5 pay to win coinsPay to win coins: 1 ptw coin=12938479132874 normal coinsSo final verdict: It's a great free mmo game. Lots of people play it, and I have had no connectivity issues or have been stuck on a loading screen. It's a great game, and its free.

It is still in a rough beta phase and needs to have a few features added (Bank, Trade system, Reduced time or redesigned crafting system, etc.) and I feel that it has a very grindy feel especially later on in the game, but these are things that are subject to change hopefully in a positive way.

11864,"tl;dr - The game is a classic MMORPG. Nothing new on the plate, nice graphics but horrible optimization regardless of build. You can take it as it is or pass on.I really wanted this game to be good, mainly because I've been starving for a good MMORPG for a while (silly me for looking at a game that recently turned f2p), but also because the lore intrigued me and, I'll admit it without shame, the graphics looked good. 30 seconds spent in the game and you'll see that yes, they do look good, but it also feels like you're constantly watching a Wallace & Gromit movie. The optimization is so poor that even people with top tier computer builds are having a hard time reaching 60 fps, let alone breaching that roof.Visuals aside (again, really good, but really choppy), the game does not appear to be anything new and it's... well, kinda boring. I know, I haven't played a lot BUT. BUT. A game should be entertaining from the get go, it shouldn't require you to put hours in just to have some fun. In all the time I played (short time, I know, but should be enough to have a gist of the mechanics) the only time I actually had fun was when I discovered that you can switch skills with the button "" ` "". That happened in the first 2 minutes. After that it's been... incredibly boring. Which is a shame, because the story sounds genuinely good and well crafted, but the story telling, even though there's a good amount of voice acting, is not gripping at all.Unfortunate.",0

12439,"So let me start this off by saying to me this is the most value for money you can get in a racing sim at the moment.The free content is practically nonexistent (3 tracks and a handful of not so interesting cars).BUT if you're into simracing and are ready to spend money on it then this has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of good cars and tracks for very decent prices. Of course many people are put off by the expensive content on the steam page of the game and so was I but buying the content in bundles in the ingame store with the games currency is a lot cheaper and very worth it. I'm not sure how the prices vary by regions but with around 30€ you can get a good amount of cars and tracks that can keep you occupied for a long time.Now let me get to gameplay.First off I'm using a Logitech G920 and the Fanatec Clubsport V3 Pedals.The driving feels natural and intuitive, the force feedback lets you know exactly what your car is doing and makes it very easy to correct mistakes (perhaps quite a bit easier than it would be IRL, hard to judge without ever having driven a real racecar)The AI is superb, they react very naturally. Sometimes they leave you space to overtake, sometimes they know they can fight for their place in the grid and do so very well, you never feel like you're the only human trying to make his way through a huge pack of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bots.The graphics are not great.The textures in general and the car models look decent but the lighting and shadows leaves a lot to be desired but as it stands right now simracing doesn't have any games that offer good graphics really and I think most people who are into it don't seem to care a whole lot. I think it looks a lot better than iRacing and Assetto Corsa but it's not a huge factor, you're mainly just looking at the cars and the track anyways. If you care about great graphics (by 2018 standards) you're not gonna find them here.The game doesn't do a good job to introduce you to everything it has to offer but as I see it there's quite some competitions going on, I can't really comment on those because I haven't tried them.The public server online gameplay is kinda hit or miss but there's some great racing to be found if you're willing to look for it (SRS).Overall this is my favorite sim for now purely by how it feels but I have not yet tried rFactor 2 or AMS.If you're already into simracing and willing to shell out a little bit of money for a great time then this is for you.If you're looking for a free to play racing game to play casually I don't think this is the right game for you.Edit 21/12/2018:I just got myself a Oculus Rift and played this game in VR for some hours and I can honestly say it's the best experience you can possibly get out of this game, if you have a VR Headset and a decent wheel you absolutely need to try it!",1

12887,"Originally posted by tenshiHaru:В преддверии выхода Fallout 4 и под шумок своей презентации на E3 Bethesda выпустила для мобильных устройств нечто под названием Fallout Shelter. Поначалу настроения были скептическими: подумаешь, очередная ферма-таймкиллер. Разве что в этот раз — на дрожжах гранитно-культовой франшизы... Но всё равно — мало ли их? Однако стоит её запустить, и ты пропадаешь с радаров на час-полтора. А ещё через пару часов с удивлением осознаёшь, что тянешься к смартфону уже каждые десять минут — в лучших традициях тамагочи. Вот только обслуживать здесь нужно не скучного пиксельного пони, а целое Убежище.На экране — убежище в разрезе. Вы становитесь его хранителем — не то кукловодом, не то надзирателем, который налаживает быт обитателей бункера. Самое важное — разумно распихать человечков по комнатам и определить фронт работ, основываясь на их умениях и предпочтениях, подсмотренных в системе параметров S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Тогда счетчики ресурсов будут стабильно держаться в зеленой зоне, а на ваш счет станут капать драгоценные крышечки.Крышечки тратятся на расширение бункера — расчистку грунта от камней, строительство новых лабораторий и социально значимых помещений. Развитие убежища — процесс небыстрый. Приходится ждать, пока таймер не отсчитает минуты реального времени до следующего происшествия. Однако платить, чтобы ускорить дело, не предлагают. Ускорять прогресс можно и просто так, расплачиваясь, однако, шансом на критический провал. Пожары, нападения радиоактивных тараканов, набеги мародеров не дают обитателям убежища жить спокойно. Но если поначалу каждая неполадка — это событие, то к третьему-пятому повторению они начинают утомлять. Увы, это касается всего: спустя пару часов механика Fallout Shelter застревает на одном месте. Когда к вам придет сотый житель, играться все будет точно так же, как на пятидесятом и тридцатом жильцах, и только рутина масштабируется прямо пропорционально.Fallout Shelter производит отличное первое впечатление. На то работает и очаровательная подстройка всего, чего только можно. Но в остальном это просто милая безделица. Достойная, но не слишком долговечная. ",1

It feels like fortnite and paladins had a baby... no building crap, cool weapons and abilities. the forge is a great concept too.. mounts also make the map seem smaller even though its pretty huge. Youre not chasing the circle the entire time like other royale games. You and your team have time to gear up and strategize.. My favorite part of the game though is the revive chicken.. Its brilliant... My last game I was the last man standing of my group and a team of 3 cornered me into a house. i threw a turret down before one of them caught a lucky shot which killed me. they rushed in and my turret killed two. by the time the third killed the turret i was revived and shooting at him, he rushed and i swapped to sword and ended him. It was great.... cant wait to play this with friends. and I cant wait to see where the game goes because im beyond impressed already and its still just in Alpha.MUST I REMIND YOU THAT THIS GAME IS FREE?!

6186,"Heroes and Generals is a game with a lot of potential. The gameplay is fun, no weapon is overpowered outside of their intended engagement distance. With this in mind, stay away from the airfield maps unless you like getting sniped every time you poke your head out. What kills this game and makes me dislike it is how pay to win it is. I have played a lot of this game and the only weapons I own in it, except for the defaults, are the M3 Grease Gun and the MP34, while I am going up against people with STGs and MG42s, and it feels very unbalanced. What I would like is if Reto would take this the way of the ghost in the shell game, with some weapons you can unlock with an appropriate amount of gameplay and then buy for a very small amount of in game currency. They could make these weapons things like the first SMG and the bolt action, but the mods you have to earn yourself. I have used the M1 Garand extensively and have only very recently reached M1 Garand specialist 11th grade, which, were it a sniper, would allow me to get a scope, and while I have the M1911 and M1903 unlocked, I am nowhere near being able to buy either. Please, Reto, cut down on the pay to win. I know you have to make money, but please, don't make it next to impossible to earn anything past the first SMG",0

You only have a single (decent) weapon to start with, and can only hunt two animals, on a reserve that has 5 other things you can't shoot at. You can only unlock ONE gun without paying real money, and even then it would take an ungodly ammount of time, along with licenses, ammo, ect.This game is not satisfying or entertaining at all without a membership, and if you DO get one, it has some of the best gunplay, graphics, and experience of any hunting game I've ever played.

4202,"Okay for starters this is not Yu-gi-oh. And with that being said, I both enjoy and loathe this game. Also the pay wall doesn't personally bother me too much because I grew up playing card games.What you need to know: 1. Twenty card decks rule the game, and these decks are usually loaded with the best traps and spells money can buy. So if you play this game pick a card box with the best spell and trap cards in it and keep using your free gems on those boxes until you have two or three copies of said cards. Pro tip, reset set the box after you pull the cards you're going after.2. You'll see the top meta decks so many times that you'll beg to see some originality... Lol, you'll never escape this, even in unranked.3. Farm Mai for Amazonian cards because Amazonian decks can be mostly built from card drops. Amazonian decks are pretty powerful, even in ranked.  You can also get solid plant/water cards from the card trader. (Google this for more info)4. The game has alot of connection issues which can end a match prematurelyIMAO:1. Honestly play this game at your own risk because it's designed to make you spend cash.2. Deck sizes should be increased to 30 minimum3. Card boxes need fewer trash monsters / better spells and traps cards to balance out the F2P Ultra Rare card discrepancy.4. I could list more serious problems caused by Konami or just gameplay in general, but these are the things I hate the most about the game.In closing, IF I SEE ONE MORE FULLY LOADED BLUE EYES DECK I'M GOING TO VOMIT!",0
3546,"Early Access Reviewthis is a good game. However, there are a few problems that happen with squads or duos. Forexample, they need to add a feature so that you can drop half or part of a stack of ammo or meds for sharing with a teamate. There is also a glitch where your teamate is driving a car. It will show the wheels spinning then have them move really fast for a couple of seconds. While this is USUALLY not a problem, I have died once because of this. It would also be better if the time to kill was a little shorter, and the recoil feels a bit unatural.

2813,"I have played this game for five years, and i must say to never ever download this game. Ever since more premium vehicles have been added gaijin seems to only care about money. Not only is the community of this game actually garbage, but they seem to only focus on certain tech trees and pertain to buffing them at all costs. Recently in update 1.79 gaijin seemed to have added more prmium vehicles and interesting armor features. The intelligent members of the community saw this as a money grab and a distraction for the lemmings in the community. Rather than fix in game issues gaijin added a shiny new vehicle and some ""cool"" features deriving from the much needed balencing issues and the other numerous issues this game is plagued with. Basically putting a nice finish on a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Four years ago I chose the soviet union for ground realistic battles. I had been grinding on the tech tree up until today 6/13/18 when I discovered something horrid. The object 906 had been moved to 8.0. Incase who ever is reading this does not know, The object 906 is a modification to the pt-76 made by the soviet union in 1963 in order to modernize it. In game it has an Armor Piercing Capped Balistic Capped shell that has decent if not good performance and a good High Explosive Anti Tank shell. The only issue is the battle rating. At the battle rating of 8.0 the 906 goes against vehicles such as the leopard 1, the leopard a1a1 (with apds), the cheiftan mk3, the STB 1, and the american tanks which are of no issue. With all of these excellente vehicles combined it equals a bad time for the 906 which can barely pen all of these vehicles and has a 12k repair cost in in game currency and a heaty heat shell expense. The icing on all of this is the fact that the Battle rating before (7.3) was perfect for the tank. Not only was it the only playable tank at that battle rating but it fought tanks that were in the same class at the same time. The only issue was the fact that a down tier would cause a massive problem as it out classed everything at 6.7. 7.7 was if not the perfect battle rating had the leopard not had the ability to instantly kill the 906 with heat because of hull break (yet another issue this game has). I have spent four years of my life for a tank that is completly useless. AVOID this game if you value your time and money.",0

This is the game for you if enjoy first person shooters, but need something laid back to play after work to unwind on, prior to going to bed and getting up early the next morning.  Absolutely gorgeous, runs on a wide range of machines.  Pacing is excellent for what it is.  The least arcadey of the hunting simulators, but certainly one of the most polished.  Note: If you do see my low hours, that's a bit deceptive... I've put many more hours on it prior to it going on Steam, and only recently crossed it into my Steam account.Lastly... for those that criticize the game for being deceptively marketed as ""free-to-play"", I say ""nuts!""  If you're going to be critical towards a single game, you're going after the wrong target.  The whole industry should move away from the term ""free to play"" because nothing is free... to include the player's time as well as the player's private information.  Free-to-play these days is too often synonymous with getting a fully loaded game that you & the developer are expecting the die-hards to drop enough cash to cover the expense of making and maintaining it.  Nothing wrong with that... that's a viable model for many games, but that is not ""free"" either.  Let's be clear.",1

Creativerse has a feeling of happiness and fun, whereas Minecraft has gotten rather stale and boring, even with all of the mods that are out. The enemies in this game are unique looking, and some are a bit challening to fight at first, but the rewards can be worth it.

A simple stick will not kill a big creature with a bunch of eyes all over its body) ",1
13583,"This game looked interesting so I decided to give it a try.  I play single player and after a couple of hours this game became tedious and boring.  I have a logical mind and one of my first issues with the game is that the crafting recipes are dumb.  Some of the recipes have redundant materials like needing bedrock and stone slabs(made from bedrock or other stone types) which are the same material. An example of this is the obsidian mining cell.  Some of the recipes have requirements that don't even make sense like needing mushrooms and/or flowers for a component type item.  The obsidian mining cell is an example of this as well.  This redundant and unnecessary material requirement affects a lot of the recipes that I have unlocked at this point.  The point seems to be to force exploration.  If you want me to explore, give me something worth finding not dumb recipe requirements.Another issue is that you waste resources because you must craft an item to unlock the next recipe.  An example of this is I wanted stone windows for my building so I had to craft wood windows first to unlock the stone window recipe.  Now I have a set of wood windows that I will not use and those resources are wasted.I'm not impressed with the combat mechanics of the game either.  All of the creatures I fought so far have a wide area attack and you must be very close to even get a hit.  The weapons do little damage and on multiple occasions I ended up running for my life.  Your default weapon is stick.  No joke, it's a stick and it's worthless.  The first upgrade is a wooden sword and it's not much better.The storage units are inadequate in the game due to all of the resources you must collect.  Each storage upgrade from the basic wood chest that I unlocked only had about 8 more slots each.  Not really worth the upgrades.The game also pushes paid content.  If you want to fly, you must upgrade to Pro.  If you want the nice building blocks, you must buy the DLC.  The developer seems to be trying to make a lot of money very quickly.To me, the game seems to be targeted at children due to its comic style creatures and feel.  In summary, If you're willing to pay for Pro, the multiplayer may be fun, but the content is just too limited for single player and as previously stated gets tedious and boring very quickly.  To a logical mind, the recipe system just doesn't make sense. On a positive note, the graphics are nice.  This is the only feature that I feel is better than Minecraft (no contest).If you have a logical mind like myself, I don't recommend this game.  Other mindsets may find it likeable.",0

LOSS BY TIME LIMIT.Since when a card game lend you a fixed number of seconds to play your cards for ALL the battle duration?! In all card games, when it's either player's turn, the timer is reloaded! Especially in this game where there are TONS of effects, you'd take time (not too long) to read your cards'effects AND your opponent's! This is disgusting and humiliating to lose like this...For those who are lazy, take their time to read cards or are just slow, I wouldn't recommend this game. Because with this timer system, the game basically tells you to hurry the hell up and play!PS: the timer is only for PVP duels not PVE ones",0

3059,"Do you dream of flying a B-17 dropping bombs and coming back all beaten up.  Or go down in a blaze of glory while your gunners are firing at the enemy as your engines are shutting off while on fire and your doing your best to keep it in the air.. Or maybe fly in a huge formation over enemy territoy.Well keep moving this is not the game for you..  Bombers last about two seconds in the air. My last match literally 2 mins ago i lost 5 bombers, from 3 b-17s to a b-24 and a b-29 to a single bullet, and not pilot death no, as in my entire plane exploded,  5 different times, same match. And thats what this game is, over and over. No real team work at all. Bombers literally spawn and dive to go as fast as they can to the targets to bomb before they go 1 shot out the sky and hopefully just hopefully they can turn around after they drop the bombs.  So ya to get points you have to hell dive as a b-17.  Tier system is  horrible, the grind is so bad, bombers are useless.  Im serious a b-29 with no bombs in bay,  exploded one shot from a spitfire. And its really becoming play to win now.. Dont let the past reviews with the thumbs up fool you, this is not the same game.",0
12918,"While I'd whish I could write a positive review, as the developers really created a small innovative potentially enjoyable game, the ""free to play""-prices just make it impossible.The producers have obviously gone berserk, rendering the prices for the stuff you can buy about 25 (seriously:twentyfive) times too high to be anything even close to fair. Though one could argue, as often done, you don't have to buy any of the stuff, that would just ignore dynamics of psychology, which are so offensively exploited here.High tier crafting is rendered nearly useless without buying the booster, as crafting one single high tier weapon takes between 1-2 weeks. With booster, producing 4-5 of those weapons instantly can cost about 90€... Seriously Bethesda Software? As there's up to 200 dwellers to get equipped?Apart from the definitly missing ""Pause"" function and the continually being ripped away from whatever you were just doing by ""disaster"" and ""birth""- Autozoom (especially in survival mode pretty annoying) the developers should be cuddled, while the producers should be hunted out of their offices with wet towels.A shame, really, I would so like to give it a thumbs up.

13010,"Nice little game with a nice feel for the Fallout games. Build a Vault, fill it with residents and keep them happy and occupied, train them, feed them, armor them and upgrade their weaponry.  Send them on quests or let them explore. I found out it's not realy an easy little game . If you go too fast you'll face bigger treats. You'll have to keep an eye on several things to keep everything going nice and smooth. I made a lot of mistakes the first few tries but my 4th Vault seems to do allright for the time being. The first few days you'll have to check in regulary to keep an eye on things but when things are running smoothly you can leave your dwellers alone for days. Just don't forget to stock your explorers with enough Stims and Rad-aways and train them for long walks and fights. And plan your quests. Some of them will take more than 10 hours to get there. Send your troops out before you go to bed. The next day you can do the quest and send them back home (and if you found some Nuka-cola you can have them home in no time). Some other nice Fallout touches in-game that Fallout players will recognize and appreciate. Made for Mobile and now for pc gamers. I like it a lot for a casual game.",1
7582,"Hello People... First of all it was long time ago since i made a review but ill try to keep it simple for the info that i got so far and Im a Newbie my self in the game i have played for 35 hours and some information might be incorrect and im not even near end game! ^^.At the first ppl look at the game... oh sh... its a copy of minecraft... well ITS NOT.The game is basicly allowing you to make a house where you can have your personal stuff like loot and you can spawn your house at worlds with you... you can costumize your own building how ever you want and have working bench and portals and other crafting benches... the house is personal and people can join you and have fun...What you can do in this game with friends is Going out and Farm monsters and do these Dungeons that is everywhere in the map and gain awesome loot with amazing stats in it. i would say its more like Diablo 3 farming style. you run around in dungeons and get loot and you can share items with others... the loot system is personal but if you find something nice you could take the loot and drop it to a friend if you want to :) and the loot that you get and dont need you turn them into materials for crafting. well i dont really know how to explain it better than this... i would say hey... give it a try and dont read comments like this and just jump into the game and give it a go  :) The bad thing is atm the Que Timer, but i hope they fix it really soon... its about 1-60 mins long, some times its really not showing the right time and if it says MORE than 60 mins its just lying to you... so dont trust that it can really jump and just lie that its 300 mins in que. just be patient and youll get in to the game. if you havent played TRION WORLDS game and need an account why not take my link to Recruit a friend link for the game its on my Steam page soon.AND THE GAME IS FREE GUYS! and NOT a pay to win game. just go for it!and i hope you guys understood any of what i just have written above, english is my third language and i hope you enjoyed my review and thanks for taking the time to read it! and write in comments if theres something incorrect what i wrote about the content of the game!",1

If you like Tower Defence games, this is what you are looking for! By now i have tried lots of TD games, but Bloons TD Battles  Bloons TD 5 are the only ones which I like. One good thing of this game is that it is free, and it has lots and lots of things. There are plenty of towers to unlock, and 8 upgrades for each tower which you can combine as you want! There are also special towers, very different from the common ones, and you can farm and all that stuff. In fact, thi game has everything you would like to see in a TD game. Another good point of this game is that it is not a PayToWin! So don´t worry if you can´t afford the in-game purchases. Are you ready for balloons + monkeys?

Being able to create anything you wanted and the how the game was tiered and balanced was a great idea. So I recently reopened the game and was greeted by a loot box icon, originally thinking that this was a bonus item. So then I played the game mode 'team death match"" because it is the only game mode I know how to play. Once the game had finished I did not earn any money. Confused, I looked up why and apparently you actually have to buy items to make your robot unlike before where you could literally play this game for free. Robocraft is no longer a free to play game. It is impossible for a new player to get in to this game without dropping ridicules sums of money.

Matchmaking is not historic at all and nor is it balanced in any way shape or form, you either get steamrolled or you steamroll the enemy team with completely unbalanced and awful battle ratings. German late WW2 tanks also basically always fight cold war era tanks too. Premium tanks and planes are pretty much pay to win, and especially the american T28 which is invincible from the front to any gun at its BR. Event vehicles are extremely hard to get and even then you need to have no social life at all to get them, and since Gaijin market has been rolled out Gaijin basically forces you to buy whatever it is you need to get the event vehicle if it requires parts. Also Gaijin doesn't seem to listen to its community whatsoever and only prioretises whatever gets them paid and only fix bugs whenever they want and not when it's a massive issue.I could keep going with the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t that War Thunder has been doing for a very, very long time but i hope this is enough to turn off any potential player from this atrocious game, if this game ever gets fixed (which i doubt it will) i'll revise my review and maybe actually recommend it to people.3/10",0

Performance is slowly improving as well.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First 48 hours (founder 2 day head start) of the Early Access have been a little rough. Occasional server lag, disconnects, and difficulty getting into the game, but the devs have been very responsive and are actively working with the community.There are some issues that are a direct result of Unreal Engine 3, such as objects loading slowly, and there are some questionable translations, especially in the tutorial but most of these will be fixed as time goes on.Despite all this, I'm enjoying the game. There are tons of creatures to tame and the combat is interesting, and will improve as the devs have announced action combat will be returning for all classes after some more tweaking.I really like that the servers balance the population between the factions, similar to Final Fantasy 14.

6498,"My ""Review"" of Heroes & Generals. AKA: Things I like and things I don't like...Let's start positive. Things I Like:- It's a free online WW2 shooter- It has character customization that isn't too unrealistic (except for some weapon skins)- It has everything you'd expect: Different weapons, vehicles, 3 factions and different classes, progression. - They give out the odd free item. - Shooting is enjoyable (I only tried 2 weapons though)- There are weapon and character upgrades. Things I don't like:- It's a free online WW2 shooter...so expect bad team players, connection/server issues, premium currencies and premium status that grants a bonus to xp (basically making you unlock better weapons quicker. Quite unfair)- Your starting gear as the US: An M1 Garand...that's it. You have to level up to unlock a knife, pistol, grenades (you know, things every soldier had that aren't really as handy as a rifle). Ultimately, this makes matches so god damn dull. I never once thought I'd begin to get bored of the M1 Garand sounds but when all you hear is *puff puff ping puff puff puff ping ping* for an hour straight, it will drive you mad. - Battles are really empty. So much so it seems too quiet to be a battlefield. Again, dull. - Wow, I can change the colour of my helmet and the colour of my uniform. But wait, I'll only ever see it in the menu, what's the point? Hell, when changing helmets, the display doesn't even update. - I have great internet connection. Played a lot of multiplayer matches in other games. Not one issue. This game? Rubberbanding every 15 ♥♥♥♥in' seconds. I played almost 2 hours and it was infuriating. Literally no other game I own has that issue. - Saving up for that one class you want isn't going to make the game any better. I had just about had enough of the connection issues and decided to play until I could afford to play as a Paratrooper (Band of Brothers style). Did not help. Very disappointing animations for the character and the plane, not to mention you can get shot out of the sky by anyone with a gun who looks up. And, saving up for that character ended up giving me LESS options to customise. - Stamina system. For a soldier, you really can't ♥♥♥♥ing run far. The Generals part? You have to put a lot more hours in than I did. I love strategy games and I've played thousands of hours of them on here and I'm 100% sure I would have been disappointed with that mode too. - Most things in the trailer/screenshots barely happen and obviously been set up. Except for that stupid♥♥♥♥♥cycle. Every time I see a German Tony Hawk, I focus fire on his silly♥♥♥♥♥as he struggles to turn the damn thing. Driving reminds me of Garry's Mod addons. I really wanted this game to be at least decent and satisfying. And although I won almost every match I played I was still disappointed. Would not recommend.

By playing this glorious game you will also learn how to speak several languages as for some reason Russians and Peruvians like to join the US East and West servers when they have servers in their own country. Im sure you are already sold by this point, but just to add on one more thing about this game is that you will also learn how seriously people take this game and realize truly how terrible you are at this game because you have less than 3,000 hours played.",1
7359,"I will admit that the Single Player (story mode) is pretty fun but after that the only thing left is a bit of Arena Play (which you have to pay for every time with in-game money) and then there's multiplayer ofcourse which honestly is complete BS. The game itself becomes repulsive after the story mode and even the the Practice mode made me want to rage. I have years of experience with strategy games and I have had alot of challenges wich I kept on trying untill I reached success...but with just the Novice opponent in practice mode, I propably had about 6 attemps before I beat the guy.How I recommend improving this game: Try making practice mode actually possible (seriously you guys..) and give players more ways to improve their strategic skills in the game like designing specific challenges to help players with their weaknesses in this specific game. Go ahead and download it if you want, but it will only keep you busy for a few hours in my opinion...",0
10098,"I'm going to be honest, I almost didn't recommend this game. Don't get me wrong, the game itself is great for being free. The graphics are nice, the game runs smoothly, and the gameplay is fun (especially with friends). BUT, to really have more than an hour or two of fun you will need to spend some money. It isn't much ($15 gets you 3 months of membership which allows you to hunt all animals), but it isn't a permanent membership. You would also need to buy a gun to be able to hunt most of the animals. Overall, if you are willing to put money into it, it is a great game with hours upon hours of fun.",1

12998,"I am not sure I would bother. It's an ""okay"" game if you just have it running in the background while you are doing something else, but later on in the game the tables just turn to the absurd. I have failed like 7/8 rushes in a row when they had a 30% or lower failure rate. This happened because radroaches spawned inside and started siphoning off all my energy, and mole rats for some reason at higher levels siphon energy extremely fast also. Everything siphons energy when you get above 60 people in your vault. The game just spikes in difficulty when you get to 40 and to 60 people so I think the smart way to play the game would be to just sit on your hands and try and pump up all your characters below 39 people and then play the game afterwards. Even so, the mechanics are stupid. If someone breaks into your vault and nobody is in a room (which happens it seems 90% of the time they go for an empty room) you have to send people from another area, then they inevitably get there too late and the invader burrows to another room, so eventually all your people are running everywhere and you can't keep track of which character has a good gun to actually fight off this invasion. All the while everyones taking radiation damage and physical damage, and they're siphoning off your energy--which in turn shuts down the majority of your vault buildings. Its great. So then you have to temporarily pull people off of every other duty they were doing when your vault was humming like a swiss watch and put them onto energy production then you have to manage to remember to put everyone back where they were before hand--a near impossible task. Its just an annoyance. A huge annoyance.Then if you're ""lucky"" you spend the rest of the time just clicking on status updates, like gathering energy, or gathering food, or the rare opportunity that you are able to to level someones stats up. I think this game would be a lot better if the endurance stat did not exist. Apparently the only way to really level up your heroes health a lot is to pump up their endurance. So you have to put all your low levels on endurance training for like 4 real time days to pump up their endurance. Only then can you really make use of them in other capacities if you really want to maximize their experience. It's pretty dumb. The whole game feels like a waste of time sadly. I just don't have much else to play so I am doing it. I swear though, the first time someone comes in and wipes my vault I am done with this game forever. Its really a micro transaction game about gambling with the lunchboxes they give you early on. Because lunchboxes (that you have to buy with real money to get in any regularity) contain cards which can help you when you are struggling. But they can also just give you useless legendary materials that 99% of people will never be able to use because they'll quit the game before they can make the stuff. Its stupid. Even then manufacturing a rare weapon took ~16 real hours. I can only imagine a legendary one would take 5 days or something,So in short. Stay away. It just is not fun enough over the long term...the only real fun I have is going out on quests and even those require you to wait hours and hours unless you buy some nuka cola (yes, real money again) to speed things up. It's just a way to siphon money and its too nakedly obvious to want to even do it. Generally games like this have you provide you with a fun experience along the way, but this one just feels 100% designed to siphon money.",0

These people are hopeless.Grinding for Parts and FPE has been made SLITGHYL easier, by removing the need to research two modifications to get to rank two, which has FPE, it will also automatically research Tracks (or tires) which is one of the most idiotic things I have had the displeasure of experiencing.

Recently they've also started making more and more Premium top tier vehicles, this gives any idiot with a credit card a ticket straight to top tier, for a while top-tier American teams were getting they crap pushed in due to  noobs buying the XM-1, filling a match that should be filled with people who know their stuff, with a bunch of noobs, making matches extremely unbalanced.I'm not gonna be surprised if Gaijin ends up censoring this review, but I'll keep playing it.

A player since open Beta, this game has come so far in terms of class expansion, level development, progression and the unique orb reward system which the games economy largely revolves around. The 3 month challenge leagues released by the developers keep this game new, exciting and fun, while simultaneously introducing new skill gems for awesome monster smashing, altering the passive tree to keep players builds dynamic and fresh (and to prevent face rolling, because lets face it, Path of Exile WILL kill you!) With 6 different classes to choose from and countless character builds, if you enjoy individualizing your character i strongly recommend this game!

Economy: -With the introduction of customizable hideouts, trading is better, in need of a more dynamic and integrated trading system-Orbs are awesome! (double function as a mechanic to alter gear or trade up for better!) Cons-time investment is huge, i.e learning how the economy works, what can kill you (virtually everything if youre not paying attention 24/7)-mainstream builds do exist in both hardcore and standard leagues-limit to 'individualization,' but still doable! -Storyline is lacklustrePros-Itemization, monster synergy, skill effects, and passive tree designed in a unique and fresh way that challenges the way we think RPG's should be played!

12372,"Early Access ReviewNot worth it. After having experienced several Early access, or ""headstarts"" this is by far the worst. 1. You were only given the opportunity to purchase a headstart packet right during the time of release, no pre-purchase available. 2. As a result of not being able to prepurchase, devs had no idea on the population that would be crowding their servers. Upon release, all hell breaks loose. People get stuck downloading, people get stuck on the famous 'BLESS' screen, or other technical issues. Couldve avoided SOME server instability or overpopulation issues by allowing a pre-purchase, or providing a beta/alpha/stress tests. 3. Once you get in the game, QUEUE simulation time! 3400 queue that only seems to go up. 4. If you're lucky enough, you get through the queue and can create a character on the server - HOWEVER, at this time, you just run into a bunch of servers that have character creation restrictions and you're left on your own and unable to join your friends in their server (In my case, Tanara). 5. Would be nice if you could just create a character on another server until they resolve these population/instability issues, however NO COMMUNICATION on this issue or whether a complimentary sever transfer would be offered because of your negligence.  While other MMOs have had these issues too, they've properly addressed how they would resolve it by offering server transfers - Devs cant even provide this or provide those in  my shoes any assurance of compensation. 6. So we get stuck just sitting for 2 days (during the PAID headstart) wondering if its safe to create a character on another server, or if youll be stuck in that server. I've asked reddit, bless online forums, and have even messaged Bless Online directly on facebook, and SURPRISE - no one knows, or devs dont respond. 7. 10/10 would refund AGAIN. :)",0
7360,"So... I've played this game for a measly 6 hours, yet here I am, writing a negative review.First of all, I'm not hardcore into TCGs. I kinda like them but they're not my main gaming focus. I've tried dozens of TCGs, including classics like Magic. But the one I mainly got stuck on was Infinity Wars, at least for some time. I dropped IW due to a massive lack of polish and then the occasional luckstomps. Sure you can't avoid luckstomps entirely in games like this, but not losing a game due to gamebreaking bugs would be nice.In general I liked the gaming concept of IW however, and thus I came here thanks to steams recommendations.So what is my beef with ES:L, so much so I feel I have to give the thumbs down and move on after a measly 5 hours?Let's talk lanes and targeting first. Similar to IW, ES:L has 2 lanes (some very rare rounds have 1). Very unlike IW lanes here only roughly restrict your targeting. There is no pre-set attack order and turns are not simultaneous, so you can hit everything in your lane, but also the enemy if he/she doesn't have a unit with guard.Some lanes also have RNG effects which are nice at first, and simply annoying and pesky later.Now the purpose of this is putting depth into card placements. Basically the question is put your cards in the way of enemy team A or B? Exploit effect A or B?Effectively though this brings tons of problems with it, combined with the other factors. The balance between defending and rushing is extremely fragile, a bit of drawing luck from your enemy, a bit of misfortune from you, and a superior force will be gone in a single turn. And we're seriously not talking about skill here, just to be clear.Not really fun to me.Theres even one card that injures all of your units in one lane, then there's another that kills every injured unit in one lane, exacerbating this kind of problem. No caveat either, and not difficult to play. Stuff like this seems to be rather common, and if you don't have a counter... tough. It's a key-lock situation. If you have the lock deck, get familiar with the location of the concede button. Or prepare different decks for... well, anything and everything.Next we have Magicka, basically your summon resource.You use it to summon cards. That's it. No spending Magicka to draw cards, no shuffling, nothing. So you have to keep up an adequate stream of cards by having other cards that allow you to draw more. Obviously RNGeezus is gonna have a couple words with you here.If you miss your curve, draw too many high cost cards early, or not enough later on, or even better both, have fun wasting half your Magicka each turn. Have an enemy with a bit of luck and watch him spam the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you.Even midway through the campaign it was common to have fights that were entirely based on RNG, with the stampede swinging both ways. Same deck, same strategy, some times I win with 20 HP left easily, some times I lose with enemy having 20 HP left and no chance from the beginning.Oh, also the player that moves second gets a mana ring to make up for being late. I feel that's not quite balanced either and I've seen many people have the same problem.And really, at this point I don't even care about further pros or cons in the game since the main mechanics are not my definition of TCG fun.If you're prepared to dig through a seemingly unpleasant meta, and if you're prepared to face RNGeezus himself. Go for it.Otherwise... pass this one up or be careful. Or try Infinity Wars, it's not perfect but has the whole 2-lanes/summoning resources business down a whole hell of a lot better in my opinion.",0

I myself have over a THOUSAND HOURS logged on it!But since the game apparently doesn't like me, I don't like it.UPDATE Nov 23, 2018. I started a new game, I'm almost back where I was, although losing a couple Golden Epics. They added ""Taskmasters"", which are built in stuck-in-place autoclickers, you can either have them Level up ONE Crusader, or click on the battlefield,or trigger your Specials every time they come back online. It's good, so I'm changing to a yes vote. Please don't screw up again!",1

6393,"Early Access ReviewI like shooters, but I'm not sold on this one yet.Amazingly frustrating game so far.  I think the concept is pretty good, but it is unbelievably unforgiving.  Kinda takes the fun out of it to spawn 20 times and die without a single kill.  Most of the time by people you never see.I guess that makes it realistic, but fun?  Meh not so much.Will keep trying to see if it improves for me but not holding out much hope.May 2016 update:RETO launched a new update yesterday.  To let players know how that went, I'll just say the following.  Their server was down for almost 24 hours immediately after launch.  When players actually got the chance to play....I found out that if you play tanks now and your tank dies you can have 5+ minute spawn times.  This wouldn't be bad if it wasn't so ridiculously easy for infantry to kill tanks...but it is.  And of course, friendly infantry rarely keeps an eye on tanks.  Why should they?  They gain nothing from helping tankers.  Do yourself a favor....pass on this game.",0

9719,"To be honest, no one should have the right to write a review other than me. As you can see, I have over thousands of hours into this game. Who can make a better review than I am, right? Anyways, let’s get started with this type of Pay to win type of genre game. Elsword is a pay to win game period. No matter what other people will tell you otherwise if you don’t pay a bit of cash, you would almost guarantee of no progress into the game. You think I’m joking right? WRONG!!! If you don’t believe me, try for yourself! Don’t say I didn’t tell you. Just remember that no kids should use their parents’ credit card. Let’s move on…there are items in the item mall which are a must for your gaming experience. It would cost around $30 bucks or some for beginners. Why $30? Well, items like more skills usage, etc. I am not going to list them all since it will beat the purpose of this review. $30 is just the beginning, and then you probably need better equipments and other things to make your character a bit stronger, which could approximately cost around $10 – infinite amount money because it depends on luck. Yes, this game is totally casino base type of things. So, expect to get a lot of frustration when playing this game. I will not go into details as why because again it will beat the purpose of this review.  Most of my friends are all already quit because of that if not sold their accounts. There are other things as well which I don’t know if I should say it; whatever, I’m still going to say it…. It is their customer service. When you have a problem with your related game support, the GM or customer support simply copy and paste their usual statement as a way to answer the question. You hear me right, it is a copy and paste statement that no matter what types of questions you ask them the answer is always the same unify one. It sounds weird but that’s how they do their responses. All in all, I’m still playing this game not because it is fun but because I spent crazy amount of money and I don’t really want to waste what I’ve given down.  The only celebration that I will do for this game is when is you know what happens.  Or, if I get all my money back which I doubt they will do.My last question to wrap up my review is if you make this game your life, oh boy I can’t imagine what would’ve happened if this game you know what happens. Will you buy the rope from Wal-Mart and commit you know what attempts? Well, only time will tell.  ",0

17453,"i have been playing EQ2 since its inception. decent game for anyone who likes role playing. Crafting has always what i enjoy most, but EQ2 crafting is a really tedious game of whack-a-mole, constantly countering spells and getting whacked if you don't.  What i have found over the years is that mentoring has to be one of the greatest features in the game. Being able to down-level to help a friend or to just do low level quests is fantastic. i would give this game a B+",1
7153,"7/30/2017 - 19.2 hrs last two weeks / 19.2 hrs on recordI found this while meandering around Steam looking for new/different stuff to play.I've played Hearthstone and Magic: the Gathering. I quit both because I did not get enough fun proportionate to the cost.This game shares the resource pool mechanics with Hearthstone and the artistic beauty of Magic: the Gathering. It doesn't look as expensive as either of them. Given the game is in its infancy, it makes sense that there are no special formats based on the release date or release set of the cards. The rune mechanic strongly influences the metagame and sets The Elder Scrolls: Legends apart from its spiritual parent, Hearthstone.Deck building is based on a maximum of two of the five ""attributes"" plus a neutral pool, which might as well be called ""colors"" by MtG standards or ""classes"" by HS standards. I see this aspect as a direct upgrade from HS's system, even though (and perhaps especially because) TESL offers no class abilities. This also removes the pigeon-hole effect from class-only cards by essentially allowing you to dual-class. I think class abilities make the game less about the cards themselves. In a card game, I hope the game retains an undiluted focus on the cards.The intro story mode was riveting with its special game modes and meaning-lite choices, and helpful as a tutorial. I look forward to the opportunity to explore the current Dark Brotherhood segments and future story chapters, with the in-game currency.It's a card game. No matter how competitive or wise you may be, there are randomized elements that are both the intrigue and ultimately the achilles' heel of the game. Luck may have it that you win some and you lose some, or that you win many and you lose few, or that you win few and you lose many. Winning feels good (for me), but there are frustrations about what that means when I could be faced with opponents of wildly varying skill levels and deck strengths. Losing feels bad (for me), but there are frustrations about what that means when both players in a match are subject to draw both useful-at-the-time and not-so-useful-right-now cards. Winning or losing too easily feels unearned, and while the rune mechanic alleviates some of that problem, it also introduces some right back.I will hold onto my wallet for now. I've taken a look at some of the starter and one-time-purchase (?) packs available, and I could easily see myself spending $30. I've spent much, much more than that on Magic, but I'm not here to spend money; I'm here to entertain and validate myself in a competitive environment. I believe many of us are.Whether or not you've played other card games, I recommend giving this one a try. Just remember that it's a card game, and like real life, there are aspects of it that are out of your direct control. Never feel too good, or too bad, about the outcome of a match; just play the game, and if you aren't entertained, find something else to do. I write this for myself.~~~Follow up update 7/31/2017~~~It's incredibly easy to burn out on this game. Might as well just show up for the daily quests and then leave, since the rest is heavily based on luck for a newer player without enough full sets of cards to make a more reliable deck.It was quite fun for the first day or two. It really was. Now there's nothing left but a bucket with a dollar sign on it. It really isn't worth my time to ""grind"" for gold/exp/gems, because it will never be enough and it will always take too long.My next review will be in one year after I've accumulated the 365 * 40 gold that should yield. Maybe then there will be a game for me to play. Yes, it's a free to play game. I don't much like disappointment, though, no matter how much it cost.I can't recommend the game in its current form.",0
7808,well i dont like this game ANYMORE bcs i have seen its changes...from good REASONABLE TIMES NEEdED TO PROGRESS (i miss closed beta) to now utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t NONESENSICAL TIMEGATES ALL OVER!you should be prepared you need things that are only obtainable once a week. you now MUST login everyday to get monthly rewards worth mastery. the one thing you need to upgrade everything is now worthless garbage and pretty much useless for new content unless you got multiple stacks of it to spare (9999 flux). forging was unneccessarily complicated in beta and since left greatly untouched.gear is way less important since gems were inroduced. 4 pieces of gear vs 9 possible gemsits actually easier to forge gems than it is to forge high tier gearall new dragons are brought by eggs instead of souls. they cost 300 dragon coins and you get up to 4 dragon coins per hour + 1 per day and random in dragon caches. also they made them untradablethe list can go on and oni dont think it will get any better in the next months or yearsbut if you found all this to be excusable then i have one more thingthey needed 3 years to implement the hydrakken and dreadnaught,0

5858,Best versitile combat sim there is! All from casual sim modes to more in depth sim modes. It is free to play with options to expand. The free to play part is a heap of fun and lets you enjoy the game and get used to it. If you end up liking it it is well worth upgrading to other modules that offer a more rewarding simulation. Beware of the learing curve on the in depth ones.Best advice is to take things baby steps enjoy it along the way.Hurry up and download. Its free!,1
16310,"Very fun and truly educational game. when it says full disassembly it really means it. it  does have a field strip as well, but  on top of that it has a full factory service type of disassembly/reassembly wherer you have to get every single little  pin/spring out.its a tough game, and  as a  person who has  owned and repaired several of the firearms in this game, i can say that it is a very accurate and educational tool. this would   be SO helpful for a gun owner doing repairs, whos  having a  hard time seeing how a certain assembly goes.  its not with out its problems, there are some order of operation- type issues that dont  always make sense, sometimes it requiers that one gun part comes off before the  other, when in real life that is not  really  how it would be. but im sure theyre probably following like the service manual order when it comes to those things, so its no real  error i suppose.great game, get it, i HIGHLY reccomend the  Starter pack DLC< NOT the FULL lifetime DLC.  its on sale right now for 5 bucks, it gives  you 15 guns  that are all unlocked and ready for dis/assembly challenges etc. the full mode unlocks everything, and thats  not as fun, if you are goal oriented gamer, it will pretty much Finish the game for you.",1

15164,"Early Access Review--2/14/2017--Came back to check the game out, see what's changed, put a few more hours in. Absolutely garbage. I wish I could give an even worse recommendation than 'no'. The game isn't fun. Making new or more interesting bots is now more difficult than ever.It may not be 'pay to win', but it sure as hell is 'pay to have fun'. This game isn't worth your time anymore.They now have a brawl mode, which mixes up how the game is normally played, bans certain parts, changes certain balancing in the game. It's attrocious. It's poorly thought out, poorly implemented, and just makes it clear exactly how incompetent the devs are.Stay away from this game.-----------------------------Well, FJ hasn't done anything about income as of yet, and just the past Thursday (June 16, 2016) they release a major patch with no changes to income. I think I will be officially and permanently calling it quits for this game. I haven't played  for weeks now, and have no intention of reinstalling anytime soon.----Old Review----(I'll change this review when it's worth changing)Hate the new crate system. If FreeJam wanted to reduce income, then reduce income. Instead of cutting the amount earned from a battle by 10% or 50% or what ever they wanted, they instead decided to slash income to near 0%. Want to build a sick double IND hover? Sorry, you'll either have to spend money, or sell nerly every valuable item you have. Alternatively you can say ♥♥♥♥ it. Not build that sweet hover, and instead hope that in the next month, you'll get two legendary drops for that component.I have no idea what the actual drop percentage for an IND is, but is seems to be something of the order 1 in 10000 crates. Meaning your chance of getting two IND is as likely as being attacked by a shark. I have only gotten 3 legendaries since the update. At the time of posting this, it's been over five weeks since the epic loot update. I play semi-regularly. In other words, don't hold your breath. If you want a good bot, you have to spend money. End of story. Oh, almost forgot: I've had premium since the epic loot update dropped. Meaning I'm twice as likely to get a legendary from a crate. If you are a non-premium player, expect this to take twice as long.",0
14932,"Would not recommend after Epic Loot update. ""Economy is better"" said the devs... after converting my existing RP very unfairly and making it so I really couldn't buy anything. Also, one of the main ways of gaining currency involves premium now. So, unless you have real money to spend on this, you're only going to be getting half of the currency that you should be. Incredibly unbalanced matchmaking after this update as well.I've been here since before Plasmas and Rails were even a thing, to see the game treated like this is just such a letdown. Unless there is an update that can address a few of these issues, I can't recommend this game in the slightest.(This game can be known now with the alternate title: ""RoboStrike: Global Offensive"")",0
5735,"I love the game. In VR, it's the best thing I've played. I don't get into the combat, or even multiplayer. I'm just doing things like learning the switches and controls. But mainly I practice refuling and carrier landings (which I'm pretty bad at right now, but keep attempting)I only have one constant issue. It's that the replay tracks never seem to work. I will be watching a replay of my carrier landing, to see how well I did, but even though I landed on the deck, the replay will have me crashing into the water, or the carrier itself. It's too bad, because watching your replays will help you get better at the process.I would love to see the track replay system updated so it is a reliable way to review how you were flying",1

8284,"I will give this game credit. It's not what I expected.You hear MMORPG and you think of a game based around using huge hotbars full of skills, but that's not waht you get here. It handles more like a 3rd person action game with a small selection of hotkeyed skills that you pick from a larger list of skills (you need to progress to unlock them).The progression feels nicely handled, and combat is fluid. My only gripe with combat is that, at least on the Warlock I started with, you're rooted in place when you attack. This is bad because as a magic user, you're primarily a ranged class, so letting enemies get in close isn't a smart move. However this is somewhat typical of a lot of MMOs, and while it's a bugbear of mine and I'd prefer it to not happen, I've sort of grown used to it from when I played TERA. Enemies in some areas also respwan fairly quickly. I see this as both being good and bad; Good because it mean there's a lot of mobs to kill so all the players in an area can get some kills, and Bad because if you're doing a fetch quest, you have to fight the same mobs over and over again going to and from the objective.The economy, specifically buying things and vendors, is confusing at first. The map has a ton of icons specific to what each store does... but it doesn't tell you what means what, so you're left to wander the city map trying to find a place to buy armor and weapons (if you even can, because I couldn't find the right vendor).I hear people say there's P2W in the crafting. And there might be, but I haven't gone into crafting at all so I wouldn't know. What I will say is this; early impressions of this game are positive. The classes are distinct from each other and play different roles in combat. Character creation is straightforward (thought I'd have liked more customization options for the character other than face and body-type) and I'll probably end up sinking a decent amount of time into this game. Your milage may vary, but as a F2P game, what do you ahve to lose other than some time?",1

Some players insist on not fighting and just squatting or dancing around the map, calling themselves ""friendlies"" and getting mad if you kill them. They disadvantage their team by taking up player slots that could be filled with contributing players, and are a general nuisance.Also, on a particular map, Hightower, players will sometimes tell you not to complete the map objective, desiring instead to run around aimlessly and kill people without end. If you try to complete the objective anyway, you will either receive little help, get cussed at, or kicked fro mthe lobby.Thankfully, these types of plyers are the exception, and while they do subtract from the fun, they are not in great enough numbers to ruin it. I've met many nice people playing this game, and made some good friends along the way.Competitive mode is fun, but suffers from hackers, because you cannot kick players from the lobbies. Ocassionally, they will be banned but thsi does take time.What is worse is, since few players play competitive, it can take a very long time to get into a game. It has taken me over 40 minutes, and sometiems I can't even get into a match. And what is worse is these are not isolated incidents, they occur consistently.Man Vs. Machine mode is very fun. It is enjoyable to play and fight waves of invading robots, but can get a little tedious with time if you don't take a breakfrom it after awhile.Community servers vary, but are often fun for a little whileHere is a checklist of stuff you should try:-Complete all the achievements (520 of them!)-Get to Rank 150 in Casual mode-Get to Rank 13 in Competitive mode (if you can't get into a game)-Do one Tour of Duty each for all available tours-Explore all the different community servers.I hope this review helps!

12890,"**TLDR: requires lots of work, not fun at all, poorly made, exists only as a vehicle for microtransactionsFallout Shelter started as a typical BS ""freemium"" game, made for mobile phones.  The mobile game market is aimed at those who are susceptbile to addiction, and the games exploit players in a way very similar to gambling.  There are lots of slot-machine-like sounds, and visual stimuli for completing milestones and objectives.  Payouts are randomized to encourage habitual attention.  Unlike gambling though, you'll never get money back out of it.The game is also a grindfest, making you perform tedious tasks, and wait for long periods of time.  The waiting times gradually increase, eventually getting to as much as 2 WEEKS to complete tasks.  That's 14 days of real-world time.  For example, it would take 1 dweller with decent stats 2 weeks to make one top-level weapon.  The reason it's so difficult to accomplish anything is simple: if you make players feel impatient, the most addicted players will pay real money to advance toward their goals.The gameplay mechanics are severely broken.  The combat is sluggish, and not interactive in any significant way.  The ""mysterious stranger"" random events are frequently interrupted by incident events, which automatically move the camera away from the Where's Waldo 5-second mini game, which by the way is already almost impossible due to the time limit.Games like this are not made to be fun.  They're made to exploit players.If you play this, expect to check in for a few minutes at a time, while you essentially babysit the game all day.  Every day.  Forever.  It's more of an obligation than an actual game.They could easily make it more fun by reducing the requirements to complete objectives, or by speeding up combat, or adding V.A.T.S. to combat, or by increasing the variety of activities available.  They won't do that though, because it's a lazy cash grab.",0
5225,"Early Access ReviewFirst off I have to say this is the best freaking brawler for PC I have played, I honesly think I like it better then Smash. Net code seems pretty solid, I personaly have not experienced much in the form of lag. The controls are tight and I have not noticed balancing issue baring new ledgends when they bring them in, but that gets flushed out. The only downside to this is the games buisness model. I got into it with the All Ledgend pack. With that pack, the micro transactions are all cosmetic, but honestly I would be more than willing to drop the money for a full release cost on this and not have them in the game at all. The Skins are cool looking but frankly just not worth it at the current costs. I don't say this to rag on the game, I say this because I love the game and I think it would be so much better as a traditional game or at least a skins pack.",1

2099,"Aparently the game was made by the same team that made Diablo2 (which isnt the one that made Diablo3). It really is D2's sucessor, the gameplay is pretty similar with the single big diference being the character customization. You can make literally anything you want, from a necromancer templar to a dual wielder dealing elemental damage. Since i was such a big fan of D2 back in the day, i had to try this game. If you dont want to read all of it, skip to the end.You have several classes to play, the one you pick basically sets where you start on the passive skill tree. At the end of chapter 3, you unlock the Scion class, which is the most versatile and can easy become whatever you want.When you level up you get points you can use on the passive skill tree to make your character stronger. The passive skill tree is truly gigantic, hence the huge variety of choices when building your char.You also get gems, that you slot into your  items. Each gem has a skill, and the gems level up as you do. You can connect gems for extra effects, as there are many ""support"" gems, that dont do anything for themselves but enhance other gems, with damage, skill duration, blinding enemies, extra effects like making melee single target skills splash for targets around, etc. There are 3 types of gems and gem slots, red, green, and blue, red being typically the ""brute"" ones and therefore require strength, the greens require dexterity, and the blues inteligence.This gem system is very versatile, just like the passive skill tree.The game currently has 4 chapters. While chapter 1 and 2 are kinda easy, chapter 3 gets harder, and final boss on chapter 4 is pretty damn hard.So lets sum it up:Pro's:-Easy to play.-Highly character customization. Want to shoot a cone of fireballs as wide as the screen, that also deal lighting and cold damage?  Want to have an army of zombies, spirits and totems? Miss your whirlwhind D2 barbarian and want it back, but now dealing elemental damage? Yes please madam.-Free to play.-Areas change, so each time you replay each area the map is different.Cons:-Visual perks like wings and stuff is paid, like guild chest, or extra chest tabs(but you start with 4 so that is hardly an issue).-Takes a while to learn and master the gem system, but once you get rolling you can make truly amazing things.-Gets kinda boring after a while. So just start another class lol.",1

14405,Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI havent played this game in about a year and i come back to the game i used to love but now i dont even recognize it.This game was amazing and ran well but now its garbage.If they kept the tech tree and the tiers and everything else the game would still be amazing but the people that made it messed it all up by adding loot crates and taking the things away that made this game what made me and others love this game since the beginning.,0

16771,"Early Access ReviewThis game is a literal meme but it still manages to have better graphics AND run better than PUBG. As a game itself it's a mix of some of the more realistic elements of the aforementioned PUBG (namely in guns/gunplay and locale) and the more ridiculous elements of Fortnite (movement and items), while it's not a perfect balance it gets the job done well enough to be a solid reccomend. One of the more fun games in this tidal-wave of BR's.",1
3485,"Early Access ReviewLong story short: I recommend it.Short story long:Before anybody manages to call me out (not that anybody will even read this) on only having spent ~30 hours on the game, implying I have no experience: I have won 3 out of the 4 solo games ive played, having quit out mid-game on the 4th one because of IRL reasons, which means my K/D ratio would be at 24 if I had died once. My aim isnt good, but the game rewards good playstyles and mindgames.As somebody with experience in both PUBG and Elysium, this wins by a very large margin. What seperates these games you might ask? Fun. Thats it. This game has a lot less content, some weird issues like tabbing out may crash the game during loading screens and that textures (very rarely) dont load in etc but... Its so much better than PUBG nonetheless. Bullets actually hit the target you're aiming at, the gunplay is fun and not gimmicky, everything is fast paced where most games take less than 20 minutes meaning you get high amounts of loot in a short period of time. It even has a pretty amazing character creation part which is honestly its own game.You get clothing items by completing challanges or you can buy a cheap as all hell pass that only gives you cosmetic items in exchange for completing challanges, which are more fun than tedious. It also isnt graphics heavy yet looks more than decent, compared to PUBG its actually optimized well enough to not load in later than everybody else if you have a toaster for a PC. If this game had the same budget as Bluehole i'd be a happy man, but it doesnt, so people complain - It's free to play people, calm your asses. I really do not understand negative reviews complaining about losing, they all blame the loss on something odd but the entire review reeks of ""I just dont have enough experience!"" This is not the place to whine about how bad you are. The most negative thing I could think of is the end, it is heavily influenced by RNG if you first look at it, but once you starting fiddling with tactics and aquire the right mindset you can win them quite easily, this is coming from someone who usually goes from 5 kills to double that in the end zone (in duos).TL;DR if you have some free time then try the game out for a bit, i do recommend playing with friends, but even if you  dont have any :( then its fine to try out alone. It has no expenses except if you want to be an asian neko loli or some weird korean samurai robot (that honestly looks badass). ",1
9520,"Realm of the Mad God. ADDICTIVE. AS. ALL. HELL. Be warned, all ye who press the Play button!Actually, with all seriousness, this game is really fun! I am an old skool gamer, so the pixelated style is right up my alley. The gameplay is also pretty good, with different characters and stats to level up by killing all sorts of beasts, gods, and conquering dungeons--including the one belonging to the Mad God Oryx himself.There is lots of stuff to do, lots of people to play with and to help defeat your foes. Pets, rare items, dungeon crawling, beastie bashing... did I mention it is really addictive if you are into this sort of thing?The big downside is the gold can only be purchased with real money, and the dollar to gold exchange rate really sucks (though I shouldn't expect complete fairness in a fantasy world, but still, $5 for 500 or 5,000 gold seems fair to me). There are some people who pay TONS to get the best gear, create the ultimate pet, and basically make themselves a pixelized Master of The Universe (He-Man not included). With the constant, looming threat of permanent death (when you die, bye bye goes ALL your stuff... EVERYTHING), any money spent on your character will be tossed out the window the minute you fall in battle.Overall, fun game, but the Pay-To-Win part is kinda lame. Gold exchange rate needs to be a bit fairer, but I doubt that will happen in all honesty.Update:Sadly, it seems that this game's popularity has dropped off the face of the earth. There are barely any people around any more, and certainly not anyone I recognize (aside from one or two people). Who knows, maybe I am just logging in at the wrong times.",1
1989," *Pros* - Good animation- Beautiful soundtracks- Anime mods made by community *Cons* - Toxic community and players- A lot of noobs- Account buyers- Lots of updates for nothing (thanks Gaben)- Lol matchmaking system is far better than Dota 2- No penalty for feeders and penalty for wireless connection (so stupid)- Its low priority system is kind of ridiculous (you have 0 reports and they give u 5 or 6 low priority matches but those who have 10 or more are given 2-3, so unfair)- Bots are much better than average player- Servers crash more frequently.Final rate:0.5/10",0

8981,"A one of a kind rough Diamond. I enjoyed Planetside 2 since the release and keep on doing so untill it might run entirely out of players one day. Yet, despite many people claim this game would die, this day seems still to be years ahead. I am always amazed about how dynamic battles can become when once you are in advantage sieging a base just to be flank-attacked by a coordinated batallion of tanks and aircrafts driving you back to the walls of your own base that you have to defend desperately. Hours and hours of hard fights and fun.This game offers everything a FPS gamer could long for. Massive battles, sneaky stealth missions to disable the enemies defenses, dog-fights, tank warfare, a well executed Squad and Platoon system, high rewards for supporting duties like reviving, repairing, counter-hacking and healing. What ever role you want to play. Just do. There is no limit on what ever kind of weapon and vehicles, noone holding you back, noone claiming vehicles exclusively to them like in Battlefield. This game is purely for YOU to enjoy the way YOU want !!Yet there are some considerations you have to make, when getting started. The game offers you a fair beginners package of all weapon and equipment needed to fulfill your class. The beginners weapons are all Jack-of-all-trades, master of none, so keep that in ming when you encounter your first enemy with a shotgun up close. Also you have to consider that this game has some ages behind its back and there are people who simply unlocked way more equipment than you have and are better trained in the mechanics of this game. This may be frustrating at first, yet as time progresses, you will grow and improve and so does your equipment. It is not Battlefield, where you can unlock your entire class in a day. This game is designed, as many MMOFPS/RPG, that the players stick to it for a while. Anyone who ever played a MMORPG like GuildWars or WOW will know that becoming one of the best considering the equipment involves time.None the less, this does not prevent you from beeing able to have fun. Even though your own tank might lack the powerful secondary guns and utility equipment, you can simply jump into a tank owned by a experienced player and use it. People play together in this game and people share their equipment. Simply ask in the world chat and someone will respond to you.There are days when this game can be frustrating as so many players (300+) at once in a battle can cause net-code implications or it can simply be to much for a single player to process. Rockets fly, more explosions than in a Michal Bay movie and pesky snipers everywhere. Just remember.....this game is YOURS. If a battle becomes frustrating because you are outnumbered or the region starts to stutter from all the people running around, don't respawn time after time and bang your head against a wall. At those times you can simply swap from the bigger battles into smaller skirmishes of >20 Players and enjoy a much ""calmer"" match. The maps are HUGE after all and you have 4 entire continents for you to choose. So if you are displeased then take a short break or simply join a smaller fight.Lastly, if you ever feel that progression is to slow, just join a Platoon and Squad. Usually community platoon leaders use 50%exp boosts to help out their mates, since leaders gain points from every player leveling up during their lead. You will see that this helps your grind tremendously and increases the chances of quality teamwork even further.Just when you start, create a character on every faction. Play them until level 5 and decide on what faction to stick with (though you can come back to other factions anytime you like -  weapon unlocks are faction exclusive though, unless bought with real money). Also keep in mind, that this game REALLY takes a day to adapt to it. You will die a lot in your first hour and this can become frustrating, but the learning curve is exponential and when you only had 0-2 kills in your lifes at the beginning, you can easily go beyone 15+ kills later.Enjoy your time on Auraxis !

6916,"When I heard Bethesda was making a card game in the likes of hearthstone I got very excited. I really enjoy the Elderscrolls franchise and I also enjoy card games of the likes of Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone. I have been playing Hearthstone for quite a while and I have gotten a bit weared down by the sheer luck it takes to play the game and the  new expansion with the quest mechanic that turned me off a lot. Any ways, I am happy to say the Elder Scrolls legends is great and a worthy competetor in the card game genere. I like the rune mechanic with drawing cards as you take damage so you never feel as though you are running dry on cards. I also enjoy the profecy mechanic which is bassically the equivalent to a Magic The Gathering Instant. The only problem I have with the game is with the card presentation but I am sure It will be fixed down the road. If you are on the lookout for a quick card game to pick up I can, without a doubt, suggest this game.",1
13777,"Early Access ReviewIt's similar to minecraft, and it's really fun with a little bit more when you dig deeper into the game. So many things you can build and craft, so many creatures you can tame. It's even more fun when you have multiple players",1
7559,"This is an awesome game! I played this for quite a while and long into the night along with my friends, raiding dungeons and counting our loot at the end of the day. I see lots of reviews talking about the fact that you can't play this game without eventually having to buy some in-game purchase. Now, I'm sure you can manage to play this game without having to buy stuff, (I have bought nothing so far), but it is definitely VERY helpful to buy something (like a better flask). I bought a better flask at one point, and a new character, but I purchased both of these with the credits or whatever the currency was with what I got for free just by playing the game or by special event things.The gameplay is very fun, and it is quite relaxing, honestly, the just roam around and take over all the dungeons you see. Although I haven't delved into the later game stuff, (I think there is PvP?), or the Shadow tower stuff and many other things, but I have almost 30 hours in the game at this point and it is still quite fun!I totally recommend this game and it is a lot of fun to play with friends.",1

You  could build what you wanted and the bot still work semi-well.now. You get crates. which give you crap. even the best of crates will give you basic loot. which they claim is ""uncommon"" which is nothing more than the most basic weapons, the old Tier 1 items from when the game had tiers.There is no real progression you just hope you get what you want.There are an assortment of hacks out there for the game which ruins the fun for everyone else, because they can't play.

Don't even get me started on weapon starvers.Personally I believe Ranked needs to be redone or fixed. It caters to spammers with no battle expertise.

The one plane that I instantly fell inlove with was the A-10 Worthog. I really like this plane because you have to turn on the engines like if you would on the actual plane and thats not all. You also need to learn how to use the weapons system and radar systems just that are exactly how the plane is used in realy life!Anyways this game is a really fun game if you are into combat simulators.,1

6758,"The game was awesome when it started, germans vs americans, but it later went down the drain.  First there was the mighty german team, but they were nerfed in a few months by some devs who think the americans should win.  before the nerfing i played around 460 hours, but the nerf was the reason i quit, i tried to join later, but they still wanted germany to lose, this was the time the M1G was buffed, and could one shot at body shots with full hp.  at that time, the players for germany were needing the less damage upgrade to survive.  they then added russians, whom, at the start were destroying the buffed americans, and the nerfed germany.  at this time there were at most 80 germans playing matches.  then they nerfed america, and the russian were buffed.  later when i quit playing and joined back, the iron sights of weapons, such as svt, gew, m1g, kar, mosin, and m19 were nerfed, the guns down sight were put further away, and you could barely see where your reticles were.  after that, the accuracy of semi, bolt, and rev weapons were nerfed, so the rifles were becoming terrible.  a few days ago, the game itself was having some players one shoting people in the leg at full hp, which i hope to hell the devs figure out, but nothing has happened for a long while.  this is where i am now, i noticed they made the sound of foot movement quiter, and the fully upgraded silent foot movement makes no noise at all when walking.  so now, you cant easily tell who is nearby, even if you check map and right click.  the game was great starting, but it was terrible near the end, if i were to rate it at start, it was 9/10 for everything but some maps, but now i rate it 2/10 for the terrible conditions that are now in effect (the graphics and maps are better, at the cost of the experience).  i would suggest playing better ww2 games now, but if you have a time machine, go to the time the game was started, because it was better then, than it is now.  #edited #1 also, even if you dont have or do have a good pc, the game will compensate by slowing down the better pc's game so the other terrible computer can catch up, an example is when say, you get in a gun fight, your game might glitch out, and a hint is, you dont shoot where you aim when this happens, so you are going to die.  i found out that there is no counter measure for spawnkilling, so be careful, or leave the terrible match.  btw i would suggest leveling all the countries up at the same time, cause if you get to gold level, and you want to start a new character for a different country, your new weak character is still put in top tier gold matches, so you end up getting screwed most of the time, by mg, snipers with sidearms, or tanks which you cannot do anything to at the moment.  #edited #2 Spawn points for the assault maps are terrible, some of the maps i suggest not playing are mountain town, town, and forward airfield.  The terrible skirmish maps are hill 60 and village skirmish.  both encounter maps are great, but once the battle is nearing an end, the spawnkilling is unbearable.  IMPORTANT NOTE: when you die, or use your gun, you lose credits, so try not being on a losing map, say when someone picks your gun up, you still lose credits for the use of that gun.  Germany is known for better late game weapons/tanks.  America is known for better rate of fire/planes.  and russia is known for better damage/infantry.  By the way, the soldier skins are not shared with each one, and germany skins are more expensive than both america and russia.  German green pea can cost 790k for body, and 107k for helmet.  American nagual can cost 352k for body, and 97k for helmet.  Russian Palma costs 352k for body, and 97k for helmet.  If you want cheaper clothing go for america which at the least costs 30k for dark green body, and 13k for dark green paint helmet, or dark green cloth helmet, which costs 35k.  america has the best tanker guns, germans have the best recon guns, and russians have the best infantry MG guns.",0
6428,"Early Access ReviewWell, here I go to try and write a review. ;)Heroes and Generals is a Free to Play, First Person Shooter/Real Time Stratigy game developed my Reto-Moto, which is based in Denmark. The FPS and RTS are tied together by the gamemode, War.The FPS side of things starts with 3 guys. A Russian, German, and American. All your guys start out with a Semi-Automatic rifle. SVT-40,(Russian) Gewehr 43 (German), and the M1 Garand (USA). Make no mistake, these guns are very good, though they are your starter guns. They can be modded it 2 hit kill, and fast firing. But I would not recommend doing this until you have a larger income, because the repairs will take away some of your earnings.The game has a wide range of weapons, from S-A rifles and bolt actions, to Submachinguns and Assault Rifles. You progress by getting XP on ribbions, and these ribbions progress through levels, at which on each level you may unlock something.I can not really say too much about the RTS side of the game, as I've just started to play it, and as such am figuring it out . ;)There are two kinds of currency in this game, Credits, and Gold. Gold is bought with real life money, and Credits are earned through the FPS side of game. Anything ingame can be bought with credits, Even Veteran (Premium) memberships. You earn credits by hour, so time in battle, not just in the spawn menu, but actually in the battle.As you gain a higher rank soldier you will get a higher salary, thus earn more money. Normal Problems People Have..) The match maker is unfair. No, its not really. In staged, both teams have the exact same things availible to them. Same number of tanks, planes, infantry, paratroopers, they all have the same. So why do I end up ingame agaisnt a team with 5 tanks, when we have 0 you ask? Nobody has used them. Its that simple. Both teams have the same thing open to them, but its up to the players to use them. So if somebody has a tanker, but does not use it you won't have tanks..) Its P2W (Pay too Win)I would call it P2P: Pay too Progress. Anything, anything ingame, can be bought with credits, meaning that its not P2W.Always remember, the strenght of a player lies not in the weapon, but in the seat. To roughly quote a person on the forums. .) The grind is sooooo long. I've seen a person with 3.2 hours say it take eternity to get something. Well, in a way. I won't lie to you, the grind is long, it is hard, and it will take a long time. But once you have that new gun, tank or what ever it is you want, it all seems damn worth it..) This game is full of cheaters and hackers.It was. Once. But the Devs have done a good job of weeding out the bad, and keeping the good. Many people call hacks simply because they are not very good at the game. I once had a newer guy tell me that he was worried he would be accused for hacking because he was 12-5. It is sad when people are afread of being reported for a simple thing like that.Don't get me wrong, there are some hackers out there, but over 900 hours, I have only seen 1, maybe 2. Most people are just really good. .)The game is unfair once I reach level 5.Once you reach level 5 you will be thrown in agaisnt the very best. Tanks, paras, recon with 1 hit kill rifles, fighters constantly dropping bombs on your head. It will all seem very hard, and it is a learning curve, but give it time and stick to it, and soon you will be one of those vets that others complian about. ;) Once you hit level 5, you WILL die alot, but its a game, try not to rage too much. Just respawn and try again.Pros-Its free-Not P2W-Has a lot of stuff to chose from, like Paratroopers, Tankers, Recon, Fighter Pilots, and General. (NOTE: General can not play FPS side of game)-Balanced-Still activly being developed-3 factions to choose fromCons-Long grind-Will die quite a bit-Quite a bit of whiny people who can't handle getting killed. ;)-It has a few bugs here and there-Flight controls feel a bit off to me, but I never got used to them-Explosives, and weapon mods are a bit expensive to maintain until you get a higher rank.Tips.)Don't come in as a know it all. Just because you might play games like CoD and CS:GO does not mean you know all there is to know. This is a different style of game, slower and more realistic..)Listion to the veteran guys. They have more time played, and are better at it. If they give you advice, take it, try it, and if it doesn't work for you, thats OK. And don't be afread to ask for help either..) Always remember its a game, and should not interfear with real life duties. Nor take it to hard if you die..) Please, when disscusing something about how hard something is or all that, remember that all of us where there, all of us were ""noobs""..)Respect the devs, as they put a lot of work into this, and none of us really can say that they are doing a bad job, or need to do this or that fully, because almost, if not none of us have ever made a PC game like this. .)Don't act like a know-it-all.Have a nice day, and I hope this was of help!~CaptainRA11",1

2238,"What I expected Diablo 3 to be.A fun action RPG that redefines many aspects of the genre in interesting ways. Class selection only determines where you start in the gigantic skill tree, and attacks and spells are your choice - skills come from gems that you socket in your items. Potions are permanent items like regular gear that refill as you kill monsters. There is no gold; only currency items that are useable on items... you could trade that currency item, or use it on an item in an attempt to improve it.Did I mention it is free? It is not pay to win. You can buy extra stash tabs, but all other purchases are cosmetic only; no buying levels, weapons, or currency.Did I mention it is challenging, and you can screw up your character?

9862,"Been with Elsword since 2012. The game now is basically a chore if you are into pvp or want to do the end game dungeons properly because it will take you weeks if not months to grind up decent level gear just for the dungeons. PvP is no better now that the character balance is super wack because you now have 11 characters with their own weakness and strengths; some with more strengths. Either a character spamming you with magic skills(x) or that super fast flying character against a character that can't even double jump. Pros:- Fun story, cute and amazing characters and graphics. - Community is pretty good if you get passed some of the salt.- Dungeons are fun- Like 10 character slots so you can try basically all the characters if you wanted.- Good time killer.Con:-You will get into routine of logging on for an hour or two to do the daily quest and log off until you can actually enjoy the game properly.-Unbalanced pvp and weapon balance.-Microtransactions to restore gear once broken, limited edition costumes, and mounts (not required but a bit too pricey after a while.)- Very repetitive after you make 3+ more characters to level 99.",0

Its very underrated, people think it's just a video game, its nothing. But an addiction is an addiction, From personal experience I can tell you that cutting down your time playing DOES NOT WORK. At least it didn't for me. It's much easier to stop completely. I cant stop and im not planning on doing it. However, You need to make up your mind and JUST PUT AN END TO IT. Unless you plan on being a professional gamer. and I am kinda working on it. This is a great game, you can have a lot of fun, you need skills. a lot of practice. and PATIENCE. Players of all kinds in this game, from the most toxic, to the most charismatic, I like to believe i am part of the cool ones, even tho the number of reports i get everyday is hella big Lol.  I am into Dota 2 for about 3.5 years. It initially started as a casual pastime and later turned into a full blown addiction. Even in college. And it got to a point that I was bunking classes almost everyday to sit in my room and play DOTA for 9-10 hours straight. I was on numerous Dota forums, all I thought about was how I could get better at Dota. My life was Dota. One of the main reasons behind the addictiveness of Dota 2 is that you are able to escape your real life problems and unlike your real life, you are in full control of your character in Dota 2 which makes it even more enticing, along with other things which I am sure you already know. Why is my nickname ""Addicted"" ?- Its actually funny cause it was my high school principal who told me to call me like that.

So when my 5 characters hit level 90 finally, GGG actually came out with their new Act 4 expansion which completely ruined each one of my characters to such a high degree that I needed to redo their entire play style...which made all that gear I spent months buying obsolete. This is definitely a game to stay away from.

Using all manor of tanks, planes, and a garage of other vehicles you can take to battle to try elude the enemy. I quite enjoyed this game but i do have a few things to note:- The first of which is that you Need a stable internet connection. Without it you will be missing every shot you take- There are certain balancing features of this game which could be improved. Multiple times I have emptied whole clips onto a player only for them to turn around and one-shot me. This is not a massive issue but is especially common for people with pay-to-win weapons- This game is a little graphics intensive. I tried it on my office laptop at the lowest possible settings I could. It wasn’t the greatest experience and i still only averaged 15-30fps. I then tried at the max settings on a gaming desktop and even though I could easily get 100+, there was a slight jutter to the way you played. Now im not sure if this was a small problem with my peripherals or with the game but it was a small irritant.Apart from these little things, i would recommend this game to most people.

8330,"This review is long and indepth. Here is the short half in case you don't want to read: This game is  absolute TRASH. This game is absolute trash. Not like that wasn't to be expected though. This game was developed by Cryptic afterall... and I couldn't be sadder about it. Cryptic managed to purchase the rights to NWN from Obsidian. (Here's some food for thought: Whose worse? Cryptic for buying the rights to an damn good series, or Obsidian for actually selling it to these shmucks?).Where do I begin... I remember downloading this game for two reasons, and two reasons alone: One was so I could play with a friend (This didn't work out though), and two because I wanted the right to rip this game a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. So let's begin, shall we?Now I want to begin by game play... ever played Champions Online? What about DDO? If you played both you're probably nodding your head. Basically, cryptic took the play style from both games and smashed them together repeadtly. If you don't get what I'm talking about here's a good way to describe it: Hit M1 a lot and use WASD. That's about it, you spam the button and then your character does stuff... yup. You get some abilities and you can press buttons and there is some skill trees like they have in champs but it's mostly like DDO.Speaking of the Champions Online relationship... I must say Cryptic, you gave me quite a laugh. One of the first missions of them game was to help soldiers that have fallen. The hilarious part is that they reused the same ""Help! I'm a fallen soldier"" animationf rom Champions online. You click a body the same type of ""Interacting"" bar comes up just like in champions. Now I know it's not fair to compare this game to Bethesda games but let's take a look at Fallout and Elderscrolls. Notice how yes they are indeed very similar and they run on the same engines... but they still put an effort to make a very different game. The animations are not the same, the skills are entirely different from one another, even the textures and models for characters are quite different despite the fact that they use the same face slider. They went out of their way to make a difference. These guys? hardly. I laughed even harder when I saw NWN2 icons REUSED for this game. The word ""effort"" is not in Cryptics vocabulary clearly. I haven't played too much of it but it wouldn't suprised me if they blatantly reapplied stuff from their other games to this current. Oh wait they already did. Some of the hairstyles used from NWN2 are altered/make a direct reappearnce in this game. Effort please?Moving on from Cryptics more than apparent lack of effort... the story is terrible and I hate all the characters. You will too. I don't have too much to say on them other than it's dumb, they sound dumb and I tried hard to ignore what they were saying after the first person spoke. Yeah it's bad. I'm actually horribly bothered that this game thinks it has the right to be considerded a sequel to NWN2, which was a mediocre game. Championswinter Nights: Online is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game, to put it bluntly. You're better off not wasting your time with this. Instead you should see if you can get a copy of Neverwinter Nights: Diamond Edition. One of the last few good games that BIoware had ever made before Neverwinter Nights and Bioware both got molested by bad companies. This game is a symbol of so much bad I could almost cry.-2/10Someone please buy the rights to Neverwinter Nights from Perfectworld/Cryptic? You'd be doing a good series a much needed favor.",0
16199,This is a very deep RPG and has many hidden acheivments and gameplay to it. I would play this game ofr a very long time just to use the diffrent factions. Its awesome. Very middieval legend.,1
8104,"This game came into my attention sometime ago. Me, having spent my chilhood playing Neverwinter Nights, was one of the many, many people who gave this a try, out of pure nostalgia.I ran into problems at the level of downloading the game, though. Steam only allows you to download the launcher, which then proceeds to leech the 5GB of this game from the developer's site. Which takes five hours. I wouldn't complain much about it if this game wasn't on Steam anyway. Why can't you just download the whole game from Steam, especially considering it's far superior it terms of download speed (Team Fortress 2, 12GB, downloaded in maybe over an hour)? This question still bugs me even now.First things first: this is (supposed to be) based on the 4th edition of D&D. I am not a specialist on this topic, but it seems to be very, very different from older editions - definitely more so than the 3rd edition differences from 2nd. Apparently, somewhere along the way, Clerics lost the ability to carry heavy armor and use shields and even normal weapons - instead, they run around with magical symbols which they basically just hold up and channel divine power or something like that on top of not being able to actually heal stuff directly (their first heals are drain and regen-based), sword-and-shield and two-handed-weapon Warriors were differentiated, Rogues learned to Flash Step, and Wizards taught themselves how to cast spells while wearing armor. This is as utterly unfamiliar to anyone used to NWN and 3rd edition as it sounds.In the race department, we get basically what we would expect from a typical D&D game: humans, elves, halfelves, dwarves, halflings, and halforcs, with tieflings as an added bonus. Also, the game differentiates three different ""subraces"" of elves (sun elves, wood elves and drows). Nothing out of ordinary here, to be honest. However, it disappoints us when we get to the available classes: we get only Cleric, Wizard, Rogue, Ranger and two types of Warrior (offensive and defensive varieties). Even the 2nd edition had more options, such as Paladins or Druids.In terms of gameplay, other than your typical Feats, we get three different types of powers: At-Will, Encounter and Daily. At-Will is basically your standard ""swing sword to deal damage"" or ""shoot magical bullets to deal damage"" things that can be spammed over and over. Your basic attacks, putting it simply. Encounter powers have cooldowns and are more powerful than At-Will. Finally, Dailies - no no no, it's not a viariation on FF11's Two-Hours. It's more akin to Weaponskills: you hit stuff, a gauge charges up, when it's full you unleash a ridiculously powerful attack at the cost of the whole gauge. How do you fill it? Either by dealing damage or doing class-specific actions (such as healing for Clerics). It's nothing really special, but it works and fighting stuff is fun. The game frequently throws dungeons your way, too, which usually end in boss fights, and are definitely a breath of fresh air - instead of beating up stuff on the surface, you beat up stuff underground. Powerful attacks from bosses are highlighted in red on the ground before they hit - pressing a direction twice causes you to slide and dodge any attacks. This makes it slightly more action-RPG-oriented than other games like that. Slightly. Speaking of the bosses, the fights can be pretty much summarized with ""hit the boss a lot of times, watch as it summons more minions and either deal with them or ignore them, dodge the occasional powerful highlighted-and-telegraphed attack, heal if you must, hit them some more"". It just lacks the technicality and complexity of a D&D game.In terms of storyline, well... our character, besides more-or-less stupid questions, doesn't really get any development. I know this is a MMO, but come on, it's named after one of the best cRPG series and systems ever made. You'd expect something more than an evil old woman who has Evil Overlord List violations up the ante as a main villain.This game is also, well, allegedly free. You can play just fine, but other than the standard ""box that has to be opened by a key bought with real money"" shticks, you also have to shell out if you want to get the strongest equipment and enchantments on it. A lot of games today take this approach, being seemingly F2P but filled with occassions where you can shell out to upgrade. For example, you can't create more than two characters without buying additional slots. Two characters. Even by character slot limitation standards, this is just absurd.The last, and most important thing to mention: this game takes place 100 years after Neverwinter Nights. Somewhere along that time span, there was a Spellplague that basically caused the whole Neverwinter to be torn down and rebuilt from scratch, much like Warsaw after the 2nd World War. I repeat: the Neverwinter we all know and love is dead. Instead of a great story-driven cRPG with good fights and character development, we get yet another more-or-less generic MMO, which doesn't really do much to its originality besides carrying the names of Neverwinter and D&D.I don't recommend this to neither D&D fans, nor Neverwinter Nights fans. Both of those kinds of players are going to be utterly disappointed in this. That isn't to say this game isn't playable, or fun, for that matter. I would probably look at it from a different perspective if it wasn't named after NWN or anything related to D&D.",0

1599,"Early Access Review+ I love the idea of fighting huge battle cruisers.+ I love the slightly slower pace of combat (compared to, e.g. CounterStike GO or Call of Duty).+ basic controls are easy to pick up (WASD and point-and-shoot)+ taking damage looks really impressive.However:- an FPS-like interface is easy, but it loses the feeling of flying in 3D space. This is a shooter with an invisible floor.- the roles of the different battle ships are too close to shooters like Team Fortress or Call of Duty- Due to the camera and the lack of frame of reference, these ships don't look especially big.- weapons and gameplay are needlessly complicated- visual clues are REALLY BAD. I know when I'm hit, and I know when I hit somebody else. That's about it. I sort of understand the base captures and the tug-of-war gameplay because I've seen it in other shooters, but I have NO idea why or when to capture the central resource/base/plant/whatever.Also, you get some beta quirks:- controls are not configurable (I guess they will be configurable before the game goes gold)- animations look like they're static, not physics based and so they look like crap- joining a game is awkward and offers me a choice I don't need to make. Either I want to jump into ""any"" game with a low ping, or I want to join a friend. Clans would be nice, too. There's very little sense in other choices as the games all play the same anyway.All in all: don't pay for it unless you feel the need to be charitable to the developers.",0
977,"Early Access ReviewFun game, lots of spaceships, from what I can tell the premium ships they offer are not overpowered in any way over their existing free to unlock versions and all you get is a money + XP boost from owning it and using it in a game. The rest of the ships seem diverse and the game has a captain you get for your ship that is a talking cat named Jonesy which is a Alien movie reference in case anyone missed that. That being said, the game is still alpha, but is coming along and is playable. At the time of this review, the crew part of the menu is kinda ♥♥♥♥ed for me and my FPS takes a nose dive for no clear reason when I view the crew members in that menu and the only thing I can think of is because it is an alpha and they have not sorted out the bugs on it and probably not good optimization there yet.""We are vunerable from down below, and that is never a good thing to say!"" -Elax Zenchas",1
13398,"If the open-world sandbox playstyle is your thing, Creativerse delivers, from collecting resouces to crafting items to building anything the imagination can dream up. The interface is intuitive - especially for veterans of similar sandbox games. The visuals are really nice, even considering the entire world is blocks...  The only down side for me so far with Creativerse is the completely server-based worlds. No local copies are stored or downloaded, so if there is *any* kind of lag with the network connection, things can and do get a bit...strange. Nothing that can not be remedied by exiting / re-entering.All said, the free version is completely playable and I definitely recommend sticking with it for at least a while, to see if the game truly appeals to you. Switching to with Pro for the addition of the glider and flashlight adds a lot of convenience, but not having them is not game-breaking.Lastly, Playful Corp is *very* good about staying active with their community. Their live streams are...well, typical live stream chaos (in the chat bar. You know what I mean).",1

This in my opinion is what made this great for me in the beginning. The camera angle istelf proves to hold a much faster game and encourages a much more aggressive playstyle. This is what made this game different from the rest and in my opinion better. But the other problems with the game much overshadow the potential it could have in the right hands. Developers of the game have been pushing for monetary decisions rather than gameplay decisions, leading to less effort put into the game overall. Matchmaking is horrid, Servers are terrible, Balancing is too much or too little. The game is dead and dying. I wish I could recommend this to anyone and everyone, but alas, I can't. Even through the time I have played this game, and I've played quite a bit, there have been very few instances where I felt that this game was better than any another.",0

After being out for about five-ish years and after about five-ish expansions it's got tons of content and it works well.Even if you're a diehard supporter of Other Brands of Carpal Tunnel Clicking, it's hard to argue with the price of COMPLETELY FREE. This game still hasn't gone pay-to-win, using eurobucks just gets you slightly more fashionable murderhoboes (and supports the developers).Downsides would be that the first act is still just boring caves and rocks and the first 20 levels of a character are limited in their skill variations.

9716,"Elsword is probably my all-time favorite PC game, and I've been playing it for a little over 3 years now. Many give it a bad reccomendation because of its claim to be a ""free to play,"" and say that it's a ""pay to win."" I will admit that I have put quite a bit of money into Elsword, but that's simply because I love the game and have an addiction to the PVP side of it. However, if you play mostly for dungegon and aren't a PVP oriented person, you can surely get by perfectly fine without paying a dime. Putting money into it is all up to you and your preference, either way; really good equipment sets can be obtained through doing secret dungeons, and that's always free -- just a lot of work that some people aren't up to. So my point is, Elsword is not 100% ""pay to win."" I would totally recommend trying the game out!",1

4622,"ive been playing this game since the end of season one. got enough time in to have uninstalled 30 plus times to the amount of anger and bs this game causes. i had once loved this game so much i spent my last two years of highschool coming home and playing it till i went to bed. years gone by and what had been a fun game before became the most toxic moba ive ever played. this game used to have a fun and nice fanbase but everybody got so hellbent on talking tash and playing the broken team comp and act like didnt have to try against you and insult you. secondly, balance in this game is out the window. so out of balance they took the god of balance, nerfed her and made her terrible compared to her counterparts. then they take the most op type of class and buffed their items and thought that was ok. then they went ahead and nerfed all the items for the tanks and said they were too tanky when they actually needed better tank items. now if you are playing a tank and you see a hunter you might as well quit the game because they are just gonna focus you and you cant do anything about it besides watch your healthbar go from full to nothing in one hit.lastly, hunters apparently are the high egoed in this game they think you can just crown them the moment you load in the match. these guys are supposed to be the heart of the match but instead troll and basically waste youre time.

Players complaining that this is grinding game, well, you have 2 options - spend real money or time.And then, when you collect gear come new mod and you have to go from beggining, thats not true, you can play with gear you have. Only thing you need is good build for your character. New mod or gear is added for us, to have new things to do.

8568,"Early Access ReviewTLDR: Started ranting or covering unimportant things. Game has a few balance issues but is fun as mess otherwise. Plus it's only been out 3 days soHonestly suprised I liked this game. I tried Fortnite out day 1 of its ""release"" and moved on after 2 or so games. It just wasn't that fun to me. Thought this game would be similar but, oh boy was I wrong. This game has something.It's smooth almost all the time when it comes to frames and whatnot. It'll dip every now and then but that's about it. I got in an infinite fall once...and my movement abililty, that is on every class, got me out of it. That's solid foresight. A few times I've been in gun fights with people who seemed to be able to move extremely fast and stay locked on, but that might be some Fortnight kids migrating. I'm just assuming there's no real hackers here yet. Of course, there are laggers though. I think there's no Oceania servers or something, but I didn't really care enough to look into it. Assuming it was just some people on my server who shouldn't be there.The abilities are really cool. I thought it'd be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanic just tacked on, but it really adds to the fighting and chasing down people. There should probably be a way to read what levels do what and which abilities do what before having to go in game and test it out. Every class's movement ability is interesting and have their own purpose, but I wouldn't say they're all good or even viable honestly. Shocker that jumping directly into the air at a 90 degree angle is not great in combat. Obviously, a few abilities need to be buffed to keep up with the others but I truly think nothing needs to be nerfed except maybe max armor, doubling your life is kind of crazy (1200 ARM - 1200 Health)I could go on a little longer but I feel like I'm trying to convince a friend to get this game rather than leaving a review to help people.

6557,"Product received for freeHeroes & Generals, the WW2 MMOFPS about stradegy, conquest, and war isn't the amazing and stunning game the trailers and promotional advertising and trailers says it is. First off, the gameplay is really awkward because it lags alot, the gunsights are really difficult to use and relying on spray and pray rather than strategic accuracy.  The game is full of cheaters and people who do cheap moves such as spawn camping with sniper rifle, spawn camping with mines etc. Since the game doesn't have much hack prevention, there are many cheaters who just ruin the game for everyone. Finding a game would take very long have when the game starts, you get a high ping too. BTW, the friendly-fire in this game is infuriating accidently killing teammates by explosives, vehicles, etc. being reported for accidently team killing, and getting killed by someone by accident/a team griefer.Secondly, the game is Free to play, pay to win because the grind takes so long, you might as well play your other games in your library before getting a weapon/vehicle/upgrade etc. or you can buy the in-game currency which is gold that can rank up and buy stuff faster which gives signifant advantage over other players that don't buy in game currency.Lastly, Reto-Moto; the developers don't listen to the playerbase and all they care about is getting players to buy gold and in game items instead of making Heroes & Generals a game which is actually fun to play. They just add new weapons/ vehicles/ camoflauge wich almost no one will get since massive price and grinding experience. One time they made all the soldier prices go up by 2 times their original price(this is now returned to original price), which infuriated me because I had to grind plenty of hours for that to happen.My final thoughts on Heroes & Generals is that Reto-Moto should've focused on making gameplay more fun and actually enjoyable instead of grinding hours to the point of playing hours of triple digit numbers. Reto-Moto should've fixed the servers and matchmaking better with less server issues and matchmaking based on current equipment and skill. If you are a person who likes WW2 MMOs, then I suggest you play war thunder because despite that game also featuring grinding xp, lag is almost non-existant because it's one of the most relevant games on Steam, it's developers listen to the playerbase, you have the choice of using many vehicles to fight with from ground and air forces. And the gameplay is really smooth and distingished from other WW2 Games out there.Edit: If there is anything good about this game, it's that it's free so I didn't get ripped off, and the sound track feels true to WW2, Jesper Kyd, you done it right with the soundtrack.",0

The artstyle was also a factor, it's not fancy, but it gives the world a very quaint charm that makes you want to come back.The different classes and the class evolution system is pretty solid, and each class branch certainly fills in it's own unique role. With six base classes and with 3 possible branches for each one, there is almost certainly a class suited to your style of play.The combo system isn't too hard to master, and stringing together hit after hit feels very satisfying. Each class's skills are also very diverse and different from another, adding a whole new level of gameplay to master with each class.In conclusion, I am very glad that i discovered this little gem of a game.

15463,"Oooh, this game is a lot of fun.I've been playing Clicker Heroes for hundreds of hours and figured I'd check out a new clicker game.Great execution of the clicker genre of games. Not only do you unlock new heroes, you place them in formation (10 on screen at a time) and certain ones will interact with others causing bonuses to damage and such. On top of that, there are the expected items to gain that boost damage and gold gains. The biggest difference I noticed, between this one and Clicker Heroes, is that this one scrolls from left to right, as if the characters are walking through the forest or environment. Additionally, if the monsters get to your heroes, they actually damage and can kill them for that round, causing you to need to go back a level and earn more gold.The interface is great, easy to pickup and understand, and the gameplay is just fun. There's also XP gain, which means that after 5 hours of having a hero in formation, their DPS will double due to XP gained. It's a small but nice touch.There's really a lot to like about this game, and it's done something very right with its entering the clicker scene. Not only has it got its own charm and style, it sets itself apart enough from the crowd that it has managed to truly bring something new to the scene.Certainly worth your download.",1

The different colored factions behave much the same as the different colors of MtG, so the game was very easy to pick up. There's more play options available on this game than any MtG app I've found, so replayability/longevity isn't a going to be an issue.If you're in the same boat as me - you like playing MtG but don't have anyone to play with as often as you'd like - I highly recommend getting this game.

Some of the quests are even unique and more innovative than other MMO's. Definitely some great ideas here.However, If you want to be somewhat serious/hardcore, be prepared to spend a ridiculous amount of real cash.If you look at the prices of DLC packages for this game, you will get a hint of what im talking about, and the costs for some things are insane.P2W factor is strong within this game, the amount of paywalls are an insult to the entire f2p genre.I do recommend this game for a quick party/LAN/Coop play, but definitely not for serious hardcore mmo gamers.I mean, who even pays 189,99€ for a DLC. 420,94€ if you want all the DLC's, thats insane.Would rather have a monthly fee...",0

Eventually sh*t starts getting creepy: ""things"" start chasing you and, as research lab databases show, there are tonnes of monsters to come the deeper you go. I loved the mini-games: a great relief from the game's jump scares.Although I think jump scares are cheap, and far too many games use them and go on to tag them as a ""horror"" games (FNAF), this game uses them effectively: creating an eerie atmosphere and making you jump out of your chair at even the cutest cardboard cut-outs while being chased by a head-eating (Resident Evil-like) monster.This game has a strange effect as I want to continue on ""just one room more"" I tell myself even though that one room could either be a single corridor (which I nervously walk down) or a dark room in which you magically obtain a flashlight(???) Worth the Â£000.00 I invested and I'm looking forward to the 1000th room (if I ever get there). Game-play: 8/10Helpless at the start.....and so far still like that.

7202,"** (of 5) I love card games and this one looks tempting and is for free. But as with all free games, there is a balancing issue, so that you can only really compete if you buy into the game.

2087,"This is the reigning king of the hack-and-slash action RPG (aka Diablo clone). It is the best one ever made so far, and is the spiritual successor to Diablo 2. For fans of D2, Path of Exile is in the running for game of the decade.That's not an exaggeration. Even when the game came out in 2013, when it had zero polish and only three acts, players immediately recognized it as a rival to D3 because of its incomparably deep game systems. PoE revolutionizes many genre staples including the skill tree, the entire currency system, how potions work, and much more. Since then, GGG (the devs) added so many features that I cannot even name them all off the top of my head. They added an expanded class system, the ability to make a personal hideout, and overhauled the endgame. Whenever I put the game down for a few months, there was new content when I came back. Every single nitpick and quality-of-life complaint I ever had about the game has been fixed.

15791,"Early Access Review>Edit 3 BeginJust logged in and noticed you are STILL only allowed ONE character per account, meaning you need multiple accounts if you want multiple characters without deleting any. They also still only have TWO servers available out of the TEN that they show in the server select menu.Just as i expected, they STILL didn't finish off Ashfall.They also force you to go through their NEW tutorial, which explains why you can just respawn after dying.Can now Preview Travel Forms so that's nice.After getting through Greenguard and being sent off to the next area by Artix's self inserted character (named Artix) the tutorial treats you like a baby that can't walk in a strait line. ""Go five feet forward to this marker! Good, now go five MORE feet forward to THIS marker!"" Eventually it's like ""OK! Now walk 15 feet to this marker you can not see at all!"" and i can't help but imagine the amount of people playing this game that got lost at that point due to it not being five feet in front of them and clearly visible so they had to resort to spamming ""WHERE DO I GO?!?!"".New classes that weren't there when i left, sucks how you have to do daily quests to get the tokens for them, but at least they give you a couple when you finish their Class Quests. I would honestly prefer them just giving you the class when you finish the Class Quests, but they needed a reason to convince us to waste our money on their self-insert fanfiction so we are stuck with how things are.And apparently you can't even get the NECROMANCER and PALADIN classes without BUYING THEM at this moment!

Anyways im about to download the game and check if they finally decided to stop being lazy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and actually finish Ashfall for real.Edit 1: Recently discovered a boss called ""The Wall of Pain"" which has an eye that can heal it, an eye that can attack multiple people at once, and a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of traps (which some can be killed, but they respawn too fast to be worth it). The worst part is, if you kill the healing eye it just comes back and heals the wall to full faster than you can kill it. So if you don't have a full team of OP tryhards don't even try.Cons:-Took way too long for them to fix a game breaking bug,-Too many Spelling/Gramatical errors (Both in-game and on the official site)-Game is just the devs self-insert fanfiction-They still haven't given Guardians enough of what was promised (basically just giving them more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cosmetics)-The title under your characters name goes right over your head if not zoomed in enough which looks terrible-When joining any server there are no specific servers for different regions, meaning you have people speaking several different languages in the same server and you have to ignore those people-Still capped at lvl20-They decided to make it Cross Platform with phones of all things, which highly limits what they are able to add to the gamePros:+Game is freeSo would i recommend this game?

12537,"Raceroom Racing Experience (I will call it R3E for the rest of this review) has come a long way from its beginning days in a good way. Before I talk about the positives of the game, I would like to address some of the negative aspects of the game (remember this is my opinion and yours may differ). CONS:1. The F2P model. The F2P model is more that the game has free base content but you will have to buy the rest of the content unless you are a fast enough racer to consistently win Competitions (more on this later). I have yet to earn vRP (the currency used to purchase content) because I am not fast enough to win Competitions and you earn 0 by actually playing the game whether it is offline or online.2. The ""simulation"". The realism in this game definitely is there (more on this later) but some bugs/design choices make me feel like it isn't a complete sim. Wearing down the tires takes too long even through prolonged abuse and the damage model being too forgiving, are two of the most notable issues I have with the simulation aspect of this game. 3. Online. This game allows people from all over the world to participate in online race events and that is great but it does create laggy races. I personally have joined race servers where even though my ping is 90ms, it feels like my ping is signifacntly higher than that because the cars with lower ping don't look as smooth on the track. Nothing is wrong with those cars but my ping makes other cars look weird which sometimes leads to phantom contact (two carboxes collide even though the car models do not touch).PROS:1. The ""simulation"". The cars handle realistic pattern and some of that I attribute to the real world racers that give feedback to the developers who then turn that feedback to make the cars handle that much better. 2. The sound. The audio in this game is the best out of any racing game that I have ever played. The engine audio sounds great with a great capture of low, mid, and high sounds. Tire sounds give you fantastic audio feedback. My favorite sound is when your car drives into the gravel and you can hear what sounds like small pieces of gravel hitting different parts of the car. It makes the Forza series, which has always been applauded for its audio, look a bit behind. 3. The Competitions. I used to dislike leaderboard hot-lapping but that all changed with this game. Competitions is a game mode where the developers have preset challenges of who can run the fastest time with a certain car and track combo. Some of these ""competitions"" use new cars and tracks (a way to drive new cars and tracks without owning the content) and challenges the community to see who can adapt and be the quickest. Some of the other ""competitions"" are sponsored by actual companies and over a several week competition that also goes to different tracks every week, the winner gets a prize. For example, there is currently a WTCC competition, where the top 30 or so drivers at the end of the competition compete in a final race. The prizes include cash and tickets to WTCC race(s). 4. The AI. After an update to the AI (a couple of months back from the time of this review), the offline experience got a signifcant increase. The AI are aggressive, use slightly different lines, and have a much larger difficulty adjustment for players of most skill levels being able to enjoy a nice race against computers. It reminds me of rFactor 2 AI which is another racing game with fantastic AI (probably the best but that is for another review).I would definitely recommened this game because the pros outweigh the cons, in my opinion.",1

6271,"EDIT - 16/07/17Once we put in enough time we were able to set up a squad where most of us could play together again. It was purely trial and error that got us there and isnt explained in any detail we could find in the game.If playing solo, the game is still exceptional, in a pair its even better.Trying to play with 3 or more people together gets very tricky though as you need to spend squad points on either making your squad larger (a bigger group of friends) or to add 'auxillery slots' which are the slots that give you the option to change from an infantryman to a sniper or tanker etc etc mid battle. Its a case of either make your squad big enough to have all of your friends together but have no aux seats (no variety) OR keep the aux seats (ability to change roles ingame) but not be able to create a group big enough for all of your friends.The old system was better imo... if you had a sniper and the battle has sniper resources, you could just switch to it, then to pilot, then tanker, whatever the map had you could spawn as provided you 'owned' the type you wanted to switch to.Currently you need to setup your options BEFORE the battle starts, which locks you and your squadmates to just those soldier types.As a consequence I barely ever us my pilot or para now as i dont like to give up my sniper/tanker/infantry slots.__ ORIGINAL REVIEW__ (smell the update rage!! lol)Loved the game right up to the latest 'Squad' update ""Devyatayev""Have 566.9 hours on record and I loved it... right up until they broke it with too many big changes, too suddenly with little explaination on how they worked, exactly what they had changed and what they were trying to encourage us to do, with those changes.Feels similar to how i felt going from Windows 7 to Windows 8... if you know what i mean?Would love to roll back to the previous version where the game made sense, doesnt force you to play only one role in a given battle and doesnt insist you take orders from the random squad leader the game just paired you with.Previously you could begin as a Paratrooper and drop in on a base for a cheeky capture, switch to a pilot to protect the para plane and bomb the tanks, change to sniper to pick off some baddies then over to tanker to hold the bridge etc all in one match... now you cant do any of that until you level up new badges by following 'squad orders' given to you by someone you dont know and very frequently doesnt have a clue which orders to give... and even once you have the badges you can maybe attach a single infantryman to your tank squad... but if playing with friends only one of you can switch to infantry at a time... it just removed all the versitility from the game and as I have at least one of each unit type, I kinda enjoyed being able to change to what was needed at any given moment as it made me feel like i could affect the outcome of the battle rather than being stuck as a whatever i turned up as.Would be a 5 star review 2 weeks ago... now its a big fat 1... and thats being pretty generous.Just to give a bit of background, there are 5 of us (irl friends) who all play together and since the update its not been possible for us all to play together in the same battle because of the new squad limitations... its just broken...

11359,"Early Access ReviewDISCLAIMER: As the game is in early access and seems to be a game made to last for a long time, points made in this review are subject to change in the future.First view:It's relatively well balanced between ARs and snipers (haven't seen any shotguns used yet) as well as pistols, everything feels great, it's easy to run as it doesn't require any high-end equipment (I get 180 frames on my GTX 1060 laptop), doesn't have ping issues (unless you're far from every server possible), has quite a lot of people playing even early in the morning, doesn't seem to have any big hacker problem (unlike CS:GO and post-year COD games) and gives the same feeling of joy I had playing Combat Arms for the first time in 2008.The game gives you plenty of in-game currency to buy at least one weapon of choice right off the bat and doesn't seem to have any weapon that would cost hundreds of hours to acquire. It also doesn't have anything P2W related, as the only microtransactions available are for skins (at least as far as I can see).Conclusion:If you want a F2P FPS, this is the one. As a fan of FPS games, I am very satisfied with the current game, especially considering it's made by a relatively new studio as their first game ever (they started the company in late 2011, so 6 and a half years ago). I cannot wait to see what they add in the future, and I will gladly keep an eye out for any new releases they might have for us in the future.",1
3643,"Product received for freeBefore Overwatch before Battleborn there was Team Fortress 2 before I dive into this game let me give you a little background.  Originally this game was a mod for Quake  another great game in the genre but sadly hasn't aged very well with time unlike Doom witch was made by the same company Id software but thats anothr story.  strangely the game was originally advertized as a gritty military shooter in 1998 but the game was delayed many times and finally in 2007  intead of a generic grim military shooter that has been done to death at that time we get a unique and humorous FPS with ridiculous weapons and a colorful cast of characters featuring a cartoony artstyle that still looks great even today. keep in mind this game came in a year when military shooters where growing stale and were taking themselves too seriously so when this game came out people felt it was a breath fresh air because this game tried something new with the genre now because TF2 did so well we have great cartoony FPS games like Overwatch and Splatoon. This game has very fast-paced and fun multiplayer gameplay that is chalk full of well designed maps. their are 9 classes to choose from The Scout, The Heavy, The Spy, The Soldier, The Medic , The Pyro The Engineer and the Demoman each of witch have there own special abilites and fighting styles The Medic can heal people The Engineer an make turrets Scout can club people and stun them Demoman blows things up and Heavy and turn invinsible for a short period of time after eating chocolate thats only the basic moves  Ok  Despite reinventing the genre  The biggest problem i have with this game is that it has microtransactions galore and anyone would agree that is bull also theirs no balance inbetween classes some of them feel weaker (The Scout  or the Medic) or just plan cheap like the Spy people aways pick the Spy because he can discise himself as other characters and take them out and that's why I hate him he is very unpredictable you walking and then all of a sudden BAM your dead. ok my haterad for the Spy class aside think this is a great game that is just as fun as it was 10 years ago My final rating is a 7/10 this goes down a point because the microtranactions are inexcusable and even though some people think Overwatch is the better game (I like Overwatch too don't get me wrong)  I still think that Team Fortress 2 a staple in it's genre and it's inpact on the gaming community and the FPS genre is legendary and people should really experiance it for themselves",1

2730,"DO NOT BUY, DO NOT TRY.  I spent almost $300 on this game thus far and the developers have cynically and deliberately ruined the experience for paying customers and made it even worse for non-paying ones.After a fair experience in previous patches, which while they had their ups and downs, the pricing system was equitable and a player would get a fair reward for his time (if free-to-play) or his money, the latest patch has completely ruined the experience.First and foremost is the greed of the developers, evident in the pricing structure.  The latest patch promised easier research of individual lines of aircraft, as opposed to unlocking whole tiers at a time.  That's out the window.  Starting halfway through tier 3, any individual aircraft takes longer to unlock than one of the old tiers would.  The developers think to disguise this by changing the tier system from 20 levels to 5.  Moreover, the rewards for having a premium account or for spending in-game money have been severely reduced, as well.  Given my $270 investment into the game thus far, I am not amused by this blatant attempt at ripping people off.I came into War Thunder hoping that the developers would learn from World of Tanks and not drive their fanbase away with increasingly absurd timesinks and financial costs.  Patch 1.35 was a great experience and patch 1.37 is worse than anything I went through in World of Tanks.As far as gameplay, the gameplay developments in 1.37 are also generally decidedly negative.  Whether it's the selective application of flight model realism, like overheating and compression, to some aircraft but not others (essentially nerfing most German and many British aircraft), or ridiculous changes like increasing the starting altitude of all aircraft in the Arcade Battles difficulty (where you get to respawn). which basically permits people who just died to come in with a significant speed or altitude advantage... the developers clearly don't know what they're doing.  Worse, they often hide behind the ""working as intended"" line for weeks, until they suddenly fix an issue and pretend it never happened.",0
12664,"Forget the pricing model, it's not the best, get over it!  This is the most underrated racing sim on Steam, hands down.  I use a triple monitor setup with a GTX 760, Intel i5, and Logitech Driving Force GT with added clutch pedal.Compared to rFactor 2: RaceRoom blows it away with graphics, but I think the physics in rFactor is a small knotch more realistic.Compared to Automobilista:  more modern feeling, can't exactly explain why, but RaceRoom just feels more nuanced.Compared to Project Cars:  Project Cars graphics are better, but the physics are a bit ""simcade"" for my taste.Compared to Assetto Corsa:  These two games are tied for my favorite sim racers.  I would consider them very similar sims.Compared to iRacing: don't know, I'm not a fan of the subscription pricing model because the cost is astronomical in the long run.  How much would I have paid for my Atari games by now if they were subscription pricing?  I'm not a big fan of DLC or DRM at all, for that matter, but the subscription pricing is the worst, in my opinion.Compared to everything: the audio for this game is the gold standard.  If you are a hardcore sim racer, and own all the others, get this for the audio experience, if nothing else.  I mean, it is free.  The few cars and tracks are enough to keep you entertained for a while, and there is also a $10 DLC package with a lot of stuff.",1
2935,"War Thunder was a game I enjoyed for many years, I made many friends playing this game and had great times. But these past couple years the game has been deteriorating rapidly, Gaijin has been neglecting what the community wants and needs. They have been implementing more and more premium vehicles into the game (which I am not necessarily against) but by doing so they have been letting new players get to the higher tiers, they have gone against their old saying of not letting people buy in to tier 5 instead of earning it. Worst of all, Gaijin has recently mocked their own community with the FPE & Parts debacle. Gaijin has consistently failed to mend damage with the community, and instead are seeking profits rather than a healthy game. While I do understand that the whole business is to make money, it is sad to see a game that the company once seemed they loved and had passion for is now another money making sham. If you want to play this game, go ahead, I imagine you will enjoy tier 1 and 2 but it is not worth putting your money in to, it is not worth putting a lot of energy and love in to.",0

I sometimes went back to the browser AQ worlds to just check out what has changed since I was a kid and I saw a small teaser for 3D AQ worlds.  I went in having low expectations and they were met fairly wellIf you have low expectations from this dont worry!  Its fun!  You just have to like the world and lore and that compensates for lack of depth.  Another Con for this is that you can download it onto your smartphone and play right where you left off at.

9935,"Well after a long time of putting of reviews I have finally decided to do one on the game known as ""Elsword"" In total I have probably 1000+ Combinded hours on this game.

The community is very helpful, and they have made the game less of a grind as it used to be very much so. They have made good improvments yet also ones that aren't. Final Thought: If you're able to play on a KR Account do so, NA is just cancer sometimes WITH♥♥♥♥♥♥DEVS. This isn't a through review however I do reccomend giving the game a go.

11469,"Early Access ReviewOverall this is a really fun free-to-play shooter with earnable cosmetics & weapons. Also, you shouldn't believe these reviews with 2 hours or less of play time claiming there's rampant hacking in this game. There's not. There are really good players in this game for sure, but if you don't play first-person shooters, go 2/0/22 a game, and spray at people's feet with an SMG at 40 yrds. away then you shouldn't assume someone is cheating because they headshotted you. 8/10 give it a shot if you're a fan of other shooters and want to try something familiar, but with its own charm.Pros:-Free to play-Starting weapons are plenty viable and you can earn the rest of them fairly quickly.-Maps are built in a way so you don't have to roam around forever to find an enemy.-Gunplay feels responsive and rewarding (headshots/accuracy matter).Cons:-Maps are fairly small so this can lead to grenade spam in TDM. However, grenades themselves don't have ridiculous explosive radiuses and the further away you are the less damage it'll do.-Teambalance can sometimes stack you against really good players while leaving you with not so good players to carry.

8852,"Early Access ReviewFirst of all, most of the negative reviews here are either pure hate without thoroughly playing the game, or just outdated issues which is already been addressed by HiRez so you should just ignore it. The game is fun, it has original mechanics like forge which promotes team fights (especially in Squads). You can also pick up abilities which are unique and different to every class. They are quick patch the bugs that people are complaining about, they are constantly updating and polishing the game to make it more enjoyable, they listen to players feedback. Recent patches is going in a great direction where they balanced all weapons and abilities, fixing tons of bugs, and updating the hitbox so it feels smooth. Overall, this game is a fun, and has unique approach to the BR genre and this game has potential to be the next big game IF done right 8/10",1
4770,This game was one of my first Moba games I've ever played... the first being LOL(League of Legnds) and I highly recommend this on over any others. The game itself is pretty well balnced and makes you feel like you are a god.. dont get me wrong though there are a few gods that still need to be balanced but the enjoyment I have playing this game is secon to none. The best skins ever are in this game and they are fairly priced in my opinion. Overall this game is great and its free so download it already and become the god you were meant to be!,1
11872,Its just bad. The game is just broken. Update: Anyone whos wants a refund at this point shoould get it. The game is almost dead and will most likely go F2P. Its sad that a dev can hide behined early access like this. NeoWiz should be forced to Refund anyone who wants it.,0
2662,"Indeed, even though I've got almost a 1000 hours logged (not even including the many hours playing this outside steam before it officially launched), I can't recommend War Thunder. Reason: the grind. It's horrible. It takes hundreds of hours to unlock higher tier tanks and planes, forcing you to grind or pull your wallet. The graphics are great, the gameplay is great (except for terrible balance issues) and it will hook you, but it would be better to avoid being hooked. A terrible waste of time. If the grind in the higher tiers was comparable to tiers 1/2 it would be a great game. But of course, that would mean many players will reach endgame, unlocking everything there is to unlock and potentially losing interest. Great for players, bad for Gaijin as every customer is a potential virtual opium addict, milkable of cash.It takes 1000s of dollars to unlock everything. A premium account only helps on lower tiers, you still have to grind xx-xxx hours on the highest tiers and that's the problem. Freemium isn't free. I'm all for forcing 'free to play users' to grind, but those that spend money on a premium account should notice a huge difference and that's clearly not the case. Spending 60 USD on a premium account + 1 vehicle unclock is but the tip of the tip of the iceberg. So even if you pay, it won't make a difference on higher tiers. The reaility is that it takes months, or weeks at 40+ hours a week using a premium account. That's just ridicilous. Got millions of convertable xp? Use it to progress faster! But pay 50 USD on top of that to be allowed to actually use it.There simply shouldn't be such a grind for paying users. Spending around 60 USD should give you a lot more bang for bucks. Paying 100 USD for a tank takes the fun away. Gaijin can do whatever they want, it's free, but the implementation is offensive to loyal, paying users. I'd happily spent my money on premium, but the difference is so small that I don't do so anymore.Every game, even those that hold a pricetag, should have a certain amount of grinding. The difference between free and premium progression is just too small to justify the price it takes to progress.",0
10347,Seems like another pay to play disguised as a free to play. You can't do much without a membership or premium currency which defeats the purpose of a free to play game. The interface and graphics are okay but the gameplay is slow. The progress is extremely slow going because you have to buy licenses to hunt anything besides a mule deer which take a good while to buy unless you put up real money.,0
13524,"I quite liked Creativerse. It's basically a non-pixely version of Minecraft with a modern twist. Controls make sense and it's easy to handle. The only negative I would come up with is the fact that if tree blocks are being chopped, that the leaves don't disappear. Especially considering how big the trees are, you either live with the fact that you've got leaves covering everything or spent hours removing them. It would be good (like in Minecraft) to have a feature that automatically removes foliage that belongs to the tree that's just been chopped.Though the animals and beasts are quite extensive, eventually it gets a bit boring as soon as one changed quite a few biomes a lot of animals keep repeating just with a different colour and a biome adjusted name (leafy - green, moss leavy - dark green, autumn leafy - yellow'ish).I am not a big fan of DLCs, but I like the fact that there is a large variaty in blocks and some DLC blocks come in bundles for certain settings and if you want them, you can buy them, if not then don't.",1

All of the pros and all of the noobs in the same match makes it hard and frusturating to play.  I know this can be solved by dedicating hours and hours of gameplay into this but that doesn't interest me.  So I will probably not play much of this game but it was well put together.",1

7284,"Played this game long before it came on Steam.If you are fed up with Hearthstones limitations and money grabbing then you won't find a better alternative in Elder Scrolls, for that you willl need to look at Spellweaver.The same goes for gameplay, they tried to be different with lanes, but they forgot everything else. What makes a card game great is gameplay and the ability to enjoy it in a balanced environment. Elder Scrolls does not offer this at all. In fact it is the same old crap, where players who have played more or payed will have the advantages. Leaving you with a terribly unsatisfying choice of buying your way through or leaving the game or painfully grinding as fodder for other players who paid.At least in Spellweaver you can grind cards vs the ai to get your collection up before facing people, in Elder Scrolls, this is not an option. So you will be faced with the decision to either get smashed vs people or pay.The free campaign offered a really nice introduction into the game and if only the momemtum could have continued from there. But it didn't, the fun abruptly ends when the campaign ends, and you realize the pay wall between you being able to continue to play more campaign or becoming competitive. The alternative is playing the ai for no relevant collection reward or doing the solo arenas that increase in difficulty without an equally scaling of draft choice strength.The game desperately wants you to pay money, that is the sad part, it just isn't worth it. Unless you somehow fall in love with the gameplay, but in my opinion there isn't enough in this game to differentiate it from other card games. So because of this, would rather enjoy another card game like Spellweaver that actually has many more advantages to this or other card games. Would recommend you play that instead. If you really want to play a solid card game. Go with Spellweaver.",0

15189,"Early Access ReviewThe game USED to be amazing. Now, it is just an annoying ""pay-to-win"" grind. The concept is unique, building your own type or robots, but over time, the concept has been ruined with new updates that progressively degraded the game. For example, changing the leveling up system was the big feature for me that I absolutely hated. They added some sort of ""crate loot"" system, and selling items is the only way to gain any currency. This game used to be filled with a fun, fair leveling system, but this new ""pay-to-win"" makes so many things are so unbalanced, and it feels like only the ""rich"" can really benefit out of this game. I had tried to love the game so hard many times, but it go to a point where it was just too ridiculous. If the developers can please restore the past features of the game, it would be so much better.Edit: I may not have been clear about a couple of things that was changed from before and after.",0
5412,"First, i want to say that like many reviews before me, i also have played World of Tanks PC for several years, and also have played WoT blitz in my mobile for a short time before i uninstalled it because my mobile is even worse than my PC (not to mention third-world country mobile connection...).When WoT: Blitz available on Steam, i am intrigued. I think 'hey, maybe its a nice side game to unwind after losing so many times in PC version'. So i installed it and played it again.Hoo boy, how Wargaming always find a way to annoys its player.Soon after installing i am automatically logged in with my Steam account, not given much chance to switch to my Wargaming account and forced to play tutorials, and forced again to play two mandatory random matches. IDK if i missed something, but i only managed to switch my account after finishing mandatory tutorials.The game itself.... well, graphic aside, its lite version of WoT. Nothing really new for PC WoT players. No Arty is a plus, match is faster, some gameplay mechanics are really simplified. In comparison, WoT PC version offer better graphic, more in-depth gameplay, more tanks, more nations, in price of inclusion of Artillery class (which you will learn to loathe).My Verdict?Old WoT players might want to skip this, or just play it on mobile/tablet, no point playing this on PC really. No artillery is the only plus side for WoT:Blitz for PC (and occasional promo vehicles).New player... well, why not. Its not resource hungry, its relatively simple, graphic is actually okay-ish, and i think it better to get used with Blitz first before playing original WoT.",1
5170,"Early Access ReviewBrawlhalla is a very fun game that is very similar to super smash bros. To me this is the only game that you would find enjoyable then any other brawller out thier. And also its F2P! And its very very fun. Also the game has alot of competition. This game may already be considered in the esports industry, as it has ranked, all characters are prefectly balanced, and requires a great amount of skill if someone wanted to be a pro in this game as thier is many playstyles and strategy. Also This game has community tournaments on ESL and have cash prize ones on reddit that gives out a fair amount of money if won.Prize pools are around  200 - 1500$  however this increases as the game progresses. And basically since its open beta this game is going to get very big one day with an ever expanding amount of characters to actually choose from. What would make this game different from smash bros is how this game will constantly come out with characters and weopons for you to choose from. Also this game alllows you to buy skins for your characters to make them look good!. Also the community is really friendly and willing to help other players get better at the game. Out of all games i played to mobas, rts, and mmo and i still find this game less of a pain and its very enjoyable to play. espicially with custom lobbys to play with friends on.  Also the developers stream on twitch and many expirienced players do also. Also thier are crews that are really cool if you get into the competitive side. I feel as if this game willl become a noticible esport in the future.THANKS BMG FOR MAKING SUCH A GREAT GAME!  10/10",1

6958,"I totally love The Elder Scrolls Legends. The rune mechanic and the use of lanes set Legends apart, and give it more strategic depth than its main competitor Hearthstone. The art on the cards is really top-notch and I prefer the more realistic art style. The user interface isn’t super intuitive at some points but always reacts very quickly. In general, Legends is pretty generous with its rewards from different game modes and if you put the time in each day you can amass a half-decent collection relatively quickly. Reaching the upper echelons of ranked play, however, will take some time, but collecting a refined list of cards is hugely satisfying, and the game seems to have what it takes in terms of gameplay and community to make spending the time worthwhile.

7877,"A simpleton World of Warcraft / Skyrim meets Minecraft. This game shines in its literal brightness and it’s enthusiasm for just a mere ""free to play"" game on Steam. With the inner workings of a calming gameplay, it is definitely a game that provides relief from a hardcore game style. A game to get away from other games that causes its own spark of interest and an honest desire to play. An intriguing concept but not just for the young of age, for although the graphics seem ""too playful"" or ""childish” its eye-grabbing serene allure experience can draw in any age. Coming from such RPG's / MMORPG's  as the Kingdom Hearts collection, Runescape (Evolution of Combat, Old School) , World of Warcraft (Vanilla through Legion currently), Tera, Rift, and many other adventure based games, Trove sits highly aligned with little recognition for its presence and spectacle. All this opinion from a mere 3.8 hours of gameplay interrupts my intrigue more while my WOW account sits frozen on its 10 year anniversary coming up this year. I stand by my review.

6315,Early Access ReviewIf your looking for a first person realistic ww2 action game then look somewhere else. The game feels like a big #### fest which is great if you like dieing every 3 seconds. Not only do you die when you spawn it takes like 10 secounds to respawn.   First of all the game runs like horse ####. I can understand that it does not have much money to work with but at least make the game try and make it run at forty frames per second but I can't get past 33 frames. I recently got a pretty good graphics card that can run all my other games at about 300 FPS with the settings on high but not this game. If I wanted to play a game that i couldn't run then i would just plat AC Unity.Another major problem with the game is the fact that it is not historically acurate. For exaple the United States and the U.S.S.R where not enemys when i started to play it I thought it would be cool to be have of countrys involvecd but nope they ruined that to. My friends and I where really happy about them adding Russia because we could fight the germans with the US butthat didn't happen. The first game I get in to in the new update with Russia I am fighting them because I normally play as and American and i relized why am I fighting the Russians. Also if they want to add another fraction then   fix the current issues like the frame rate. Last the game just feels boring not like Civ v or Far Cry 3 where it is just after this I will get off.The game dosn't feel balenced for example the german guns are far superry or to the US weapons for example the US SMG has a 1 or 2 secound delay as were the Germany smgdoes not.Another bad thing about the game is the servers suck because every time i want to get in to a game it is always at 100 or 200 ping but for other games the most i get is 70.There are a few good things we more like one the the game is Free to Play so if you didn't like it then you didn't waste any thing but your time.I feel that the game could be better and i love to play ww2 games and the reason I am doing this is because I want to see the game do well so my final review for the game is 5/10 because it is still in Early Access but this game will need some work before it is done.,0
13587,"Early Access ReviewIf you like MineCraft, you'll like Creativerse as well. It is more intuitive than MC, which is a huge bonus for new and/or younger players. There is plenty to do, and I have yet to feel that I was ever at a ""dead end"" trying to figure out what to do next. It's a good game, that gets upgraded to great game, due to the price. (Free!)You can purchase the ""Pro"" version for $20, but other than a flashlight and glider, there is nothing that Pro gives you that you can't get yourself in the Free version in game. The only other difference is on the Free version you are limited to one world at a time (Or you can play online on other people's servers). If you have Pro, you can have multiple worlds and more control over the settings for them.Personally. I feel that the $20 is a bit overpriced for what you get. (I get that the developers need, and deserve, to get paid.) If the Pro was $10, I would say jump on it in a heartbeat. Who knows, maybe it will go on sale someday!Graphics: Really nice. (Way better than minecraft. The world has a fun, and kinda ""cartoony"" feel to it.) Also, it runs great on my laptop, which means it should run great on tons of systems. 7/10Sound: Sounds a lot like MC. Which isn't a bad thing. 7/10Gameplay: Controls are good and responsive. Your character moves pretty predictably. Lots to see and do. Many different ways to play, depending on how you prefer. 8/10Re-Playability: Just like other open-world sandbox games. You might get bored after awhile, but wait a few weeks/months and you will get hooked again. (Repeat as needed.) 9/10Overall: 7.5 / 10 (Great)",1

4874,"My first experience with a MOBA, and I don't think I'll be switching to LoL or DOTA anytime soon.You know how you get ""that game"" that you end up playing no matter what? This is that game. Fallout 4 is out? This is free, and I need to scratch my itch. Smite is a very well balanced 3rd person take on a MOBA that can attract anyone from a hardcore LoL player to a gamer whose never stepped foot in the genre (aka myself). Besides the current hours I have, another 500 can be added from Xbox playtime. The game is very easy to get into as a casual, but also very fun for people who love to customize builds and find what numbers need to be allocated where to be the most effective (power, attack speed, protections, etc.).Smite is constantly updated, with small patches every few weeks. Also, a new god is added every month or two, allowing the player to always have someone new to try. When you first start out, you are given a few free gods (some are top tier, think of stock guns in TF2) and a few gods are free every week for you to test drive. I would highly recommend the God Pack for anyone who thinks they will sink a decent amount of time into the game. It makes you much more flexible as a player, gives variety to the game, and lets you try what seems to be an endless amount of playstyles that you may have not be able to experience prior. Gems, Smite's premium currency, is given in small doeses every week from logging in, can be bought, and is often given for free from weekend events. Also, skins/voice packs are often on sale. Devs are in constant contact on r/Smite and Twitter, making it extremely easy to contact them for any concerns, and easy for them to see community ideas. They are also some pretty fun guys that are always fun to see on stream or during events.The game's free, give it a try and see how you like it. Make sure to look up builds/guides online to make sure you get the most out of the game. Have fun!",1

5028,"Early Access ReviewIf you just started this game and thought that there are certain legends more OP than others, or spamming is ruining the game, give yourself some time to learn the game. Almost every fighting game has spammers which are really easy to deal with once you get the hang of it.But as for legends? Every legend is seriously balanced (while some are underpowered and hard to master, but if you like challenge and have some patience, they'll certainly do the same job as other legends). Devs listen to the community and they keep balancing the game on regular basis (every week or something).I for one hated my first time in game when I faced the wave of spammers (and hattoris heh), but thank god I met some of the nicest and greatest players in the community, they helped me understand the basic mechanics of the game and how to deal with such stuff easily. I'm posting this for those people with low luck of meeting some nice players and wanna quit after their 30 minutes of playing.

15743,"Early Access ReviewHave always loved the meta 4th wall breaking dialogue in AE games since the original Adventure Quest flash game ages ago, and now they are bringing it to a 3d mmorpg?! Love the simplicity of the game and the traditional mmorpg flavor, meaning lots of grinding, but its done well so it feels rewarding and enjoyable.  So far the community has also been great, and friendly for the most part (there will always be trolls somewhere lol).  My favority part is I can login and play on here when at a pc and I can login with my tablet at any time without any issues, and the same account, same friends, def true cross platform.Right now its in open beta, so that means lots of stuff will be added, including but not limited to at least 100 total player levels, tons of new classes (a lot from Adventure Quest Worlds even), trading, group/party system, minimum level requirement for specific instances(keep those lowbies from ruining the raids), housing system, item fusion(keeping the look of an item but stats of another), raid events/dungeons etc.It is free 2 play and they are keeping to the idea that the only thing the paid for currency Dragon Coins can be used for is for convenience such as buying a craftable item without grinding for the materials for it, xp potions and some aesthetics.So far however there is one class (Guardian) that is only available as a purchase, its great tank class and has its own quests and what not associated with it as well and as far as inforation is available is the only class that will require payment for, like a dlc.  I thought it was worth it to support the devs, and if you do not have it you are not really losing out as it does not provide the best gear in the game it just provides some awesome looking gear.  And if I remember correctlyl there will be dozens of classes anyways, so 1 that you have to buy to support the devs in my opinion is fair (and worth buying and supporting them for).The best part for me, it works very well on our crappy computers at work, rather it actually works on them lol, and it works fluidly on my tablet, so something I can enjoy playing without technical limitations or control/mechanics limitations.If you love traditional mmorpgs, you love hats, you love awesome armor and weapons, or just want to be able to get your mmo fix on the go, this is the game for you.  Plus I will be there so what's more to love?",1

2885,It's planes or tanks.  The plane sim is pretty poor.  For the price of a premium plane you can buy IL-2 1946 or cliffs of Dover.  Both are much much better.

You cannot view i9t through windows control panel and you can only get rid of it by manually deleting the registry.  Do not Download.  This game is basically a virus.,0

13100,"Fallout Shelter is a F2P game that originally surfaced on mobile devices a few years ago shortly before the release of Fallout 4. I remember completely failing at the task at hand and had my Vault and its Dwellers silenced forever due to a series of unfortunate events. I can only remember Deathclaws and my poorly equipped bunch valiantly defending their incompetent Overseer.  Recently the game was released on Steam and I thought it best to try and redeem this Overseer's tarnished record. The good news is that Vault 757 is flourishing nicely and has a lovely bunch of Dwellers who either wander around taskless or work 24/7 365 days of the year doing what they know best... constantly turning a valve.  I have to say that having had a fresh approach to the game, it is really accessible and it  is refreshing  not to have microfractions constantly pinging up asking you to spend more and more until your savings are  non-existent.  You can have it running in the background while you do some work or browse the latest news. Yes, tasks can be repetitive and you do have to wait to reach quests(Which is the interesting part). However I'm sure you have more important things to do rather than mindlessly click on tabs... If you get tired, you can buy a few  Mr Handys to automatically collect resources. Just be careful not to have them engage with raids or infestations as these lovely machines cost 2000 caps each to repair. It's a neat little management game and I would recommend you give it a go. Just remember to keep those Stimpaks and RadAways stocked and you'll do just fine!  ",1

6244,"PHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEW I have waited a long time to write this review.  Heroes and Generals is the best made game I have ever played, but... the most poorley made game I have ever played.  You start up the game, pick a faction: Russia     (The one everybody loves), Germany, (The one everybody hates), and the Allies (The other one). When you first start playing, it starts you off against players like you that have no idea what they are doing, and you generally have a good time.  Then they move you to the next tier where you get a good feel for what the game will be like, with smgs, semi auto rifles, bolt action rifles and good stuff like that.  Also, you die super fast, and don't expect to have health regen.  If you get hurt, the game will not help you out, so you need to look for med crates placed conveniently (or inconveniently) around the map.  Same thing goes with looking for an ammo cache or anti-tank weapons.  But you will die (Trust me, you will) and you will spawn back in... AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP HAHAHAHAHA!  Yes, you need to walk all the way back to everywere once you die.  I suggest that you invest in your faction's truck early on.  Speaking of vehicles, the gameplay with them is crazy, fun and filled with tons of explosions and lots of messed up physics.  But they have one other type of vehicle... Tanks.  Oh dear lord TANKS!  Where do I even begin... Okay.  I can do this.  You will have PTSD after playing for the first time with tanks.  They are OP as balls and make you die and respawn, but we already covered that.  If you don't take the game seriousley, as I often just mess around, they can add some fun to the game, but you will never meet somebody that just played a match with tanks and said that they liked it.  Oh, and planes are the same thing, except you can't destroy them NEARLEY as easily as you can with tanks.  Then I bought a tanker and pretty much beat the game.Now, I will tank I mean TALK about the largest issue with the game.  The Grind.  After the first set of vehicles and weapons, tier II weapons all cost way too much.  You can't make the money that you need because of another system I will talk about later.  Because of the low amount of maps to play on, there is almost nothing else to do accept grinding for xp and weapons.  You can't even immediatley get the weapon that you want because you don't have the xp in a certain ribbon to buy it.  I will give you an example.  Say I am playing as the Allies.  I want the Thompson SMG, a Ka Bar knife and some stick grenades.  I have the M1 Garand, and I level up my infantry assault ribon to level 4 to get the Grease Gun SMG and some Pinaple Grenades.  Now I buy a shovel, because I need to get to level 5 in close combat to unlock the knife.  I use the SMG, but then i'm not using the grenades, so I can't level up in explosives.  I switch to grenades, but then i'm not using my shovel so i'm not leveling up close combat.  I use my shovel, but then i'm not using my SMG.  I pick up the smg that the enemy I just killed dropped and use that.  But then i'm not getting xp in my Grease Gun so i can upgrade it.  So it goes in a terrible circle.I do like one system in the game, beleive it or not: The weapon upgrade system.  If you use a weapon of your faction a lot, you will be given the oppertunity to buy upgrades for it, like springs, sights, barrels and some cosmetic things like skins.  I like this system because the game rewards you for using the weapons that you enjoy most.  For instance, I like the M1 Garand.  A lot.  I first used it as a sniper weapon, changing the ammo, getting better gas sealing and even a scope.  But then I changed it to a close-quarters weapon, taking off the scope, lowering the percision and damage while cranking up the rate of fire.  There is a downside to this system, however.The game's repair system, Ho MAMA.  Every bullet you fire, every vehicle you spawn, every grenade you throw and every tank shell that you shoot has a price tag.  It costs money, lots of it.  I kind of like the system, as it makes you ration your resourses and only fire when nessecary, but other times you actually lose money between games for no fault of your own.  Also, you guessed it- upgrades cost money between matches, so the game also punishes you for using them, which is a little strange.Here are my suggestions to make this game better.1. Add more weapons, so skill trees don't only unlock you one or two weapons2. Lower the prices on everything, the game grinds on for way to long3. Add more maps, the only thing that keeps you going is unlocking new weapons and tools, playing on the same maps over and over again gets tiresome very fast.4.Balance your damn tanks5.Place spawn points much closer to the action.Okay... My opinion of this game... I like this game and want it to be good, but it is constantley held back from all these problems.  And I know fanboys of this game will eagerley tell me that they are working on adding more weapons and maps and all that good stuff, but that is NO excuse for what we have NOW.  They should have waited much longer on releasing this game, as I am being shot through walls and spawncamped by dreadful tanks.  But one redeeming feature is that it is completley free to play, as of now.  My final rating for Heroes and Generals is a 7/10.I will continue to update this review as the game progresses.  That will be added to the bottem of the review",1

And no, I don't mean pay to win; you need to pay to even begin to play.* The whole game is trial and error. If you encounter something you haven't done before you will die.* When you die you lose all your items (perma-death).* Enemies are spastic and shoot a billion bullets spamming them and predicting where you will go.

I spend the first hour just trying to get into the game, loading screen of death showed up a lot, locking me in place and forcing me to restart the game over and over and then once I finally get past that? Queue simulator due to the lack of servers at launch, come on guys, you must of known that you'd need way more than just one for each region.The server lag more or less makes the game near unplayable, In fact when I first started and got onto the airship to move to the main town of my faction the airship ended up kicking me off randomly into an enemy factions area, filled with high level monsters along with players which instantly went for me. As the game currently is? It feels like they just don't care but I'm hoping I'm wrong and that they end up fixing some of the issues this game has.Though I have many more issues in which I could list, I feel there's enough mentioning of those already so a brief list shall suffice, right now? I can't recommend this game to anyone, wait for a while until they (Hopefully) fix these issues because right now you'll just end up getting frustrated, be disappointed and probably decide not to give it a second chance.",0
9162,"Insanely awesome. Those are the best two words that describe this game. No other shooter perfectly captures the epic sci-fi battles that take place as three massive armies clash for territory. When you walk into a battle, you don't just see people pointing, shooting and killing. You've got several heavy assaults laying down suppressive fire while the medics are running around, dodging bullets and fearlessly jumping into the heart of battle to save their fallen comrades. Then a platoon of tanks comes rolling in, cannons blazing, followed by a Galaxy dropping more troops while the gunners cover and fighters duking it out for air supremacy in the skies above, dodging the relentless AA fire.And that's just a little bit of the everyday battle for territory. It's also my favorite part about this game: the intense cinematic battles and sights that no other shooter replicates quite as well.The only downsides I can think of is this game lags any computer like crazy, even my really high-end PC. Also, there is a little too much pay-to-win present.9.5/10",1

During that time I have met a lot of great people, and also quite a bunch of people who I wish I'd never meet.Unfortunately, I've joined the scene quite late as I first started playing this in January 2011, a point where the game was still optimized and still fun. As years passed by I've seen the game go downhill more and more each update. The performance of the game was getting worse and the content Valve kept adding was not contributing to the game one single bit, if anything it just killed more and more frames on a lot of machines, no matter how powerful they are.The latest update ""Meet your Match"" was the final straw for me. Them replacing pub servers with ""Casual"" servers, which are basically pubs with a competitive setting really didn't do it for me. Competitive could've kept this game alive if they implemented this years ago. If you ask me, they are way too late with doing this and I personally do not see a future for this game anymore.If anyone would ask me, I would not recommend Team Fortress 2 to anyone. Even though I have never played Overwatch, I'd say that game holds a much greater future than TF2 would ever achieve.EDIT: Well then, to my surprise they're actually doing something about this whole issue. Way to go, I guess?EDIT 2: My opinion still stands. This game is nothing but a broken pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥EDIT 3: I moved over to Overwatch, much better game than TF2. Get it now, seriously.",0
17219,"395249 brain cells died playing this game. I hate it.Here's why:Saturday, April 2th 2016I was looking for some Steam games, and i found this. I loved How to Train your Dragon 1 and 2, and even the Netflix mini-series. I thought it would be a decent game, after seeing the good reviews, (I only see the bad reviews after getting the game, for some reason) and, after all, its only $0.00 (+ over $100.00 in in-game content).The first thing you notice when you turn on the game is that you made some pretty bad life choices. The second thing you notice is that you are already praying for God to have mercy on your soul. The third thing you is  When you get to play the game, you need to make an account, or you get named ""VIKING18346718"" so i made an account, and i chose the name ""Pingas"". And it said it had symbols. Really? Ok. I can live with that. Named my character ""ButterGamer"" in homenage for PBG. The game wouldn't let me name it that way cuz' it had the word ""Butt"" in it.Finnaly got to the game aaaaaand... wasted 1 minute and 5.12 seconds waiting for the game to load. Aaaaaaaaand... Wasted another minute cuz the game was downloading stuff. Aaaaaaaand FINALY got to play the game. What i saw was atrocious. The quality of the graphics were terrible. I mean... this game was made in 2014 and even still, it looks like the graphics were made by an 11 year old learning how to make a game, or this game was made with the same program the GameCube games were made.The genious that made this game decided not to give any collision detection to some of the NPC characters (and sometimes, you fall under the floor).After that, i just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and uninstalled it. Wait, you can fly as Toothless?10/10 BEST GAME 2014",0
10247,"Expansive Worlds could use some help from Fishing Planet, LLC when it comes to simulators like these. Fishing Planet is on Early Access (and free to play), and certainly has its own problems, much like theHunter, but is far more accessible even though there are a plethora of DLC. I wish Fishing Planet would pick up this game and overhaul it.The issue with theHunter is not that the gameplay isn't good. The gameplay is actually great. Tracking animals works like it should, animals get spooked properly, the shooting is nice, and surroundings are, while not visually brilliant, immersive.The issue is that the game is EXTREMELY gated behind paid subscriptions, which inevitably end up in you spending 100s of dollars. It's just not worth it to anyone other than BIG TIME hunting fans, who can't get their fix during the hunting season alone.",0
14333,"This game is just as bad as it was the first time. They keep reinventing the game title to suck in new players without making any positive changes. No improvements to the animations, character models, environment, gameplay, no story. The only ""New"" thing about this game is the added paid subscriptions for their crap content. These developers only excel at robbing your money without providing an experience that was worth the price.",0
10454,Ok so after a few hours playing this game i can honestly say i really liked it. The negative reviews are people crying because they expect something for nothing. This is F2P i have been for some time now. Every week the animals you can hunt are rotated you also start with two guns and five types of ammo which can deal with most of the creatures. Yes there is a lot of things to buy in the game but you are not being forced to and you earn in game money for your kills. My personal advice would be to get a 12 month mebership which i think is £30 and with that you get so much extra stuff plus the right to hunt what ever you like. So if your into your hunting give it a try and see for yourself.,1

9781,"A pretty cool side-scroller MMO that's quite fun and addicting! Playing with friends is much better, but playing alone is also rewarding. Despite some of the features being locked to having to spend real money on them, the game's not much of a ""pay to win"" as some other games around, so you can probably have fun with it without even spending one dime.So far, up to this point, I give this game an easy 8/10.",1
15470,"The game is pay to win. There is no end game, and only endless chests or hours of mindless grinding will get you real progress. The problem is the loot system which works on a 5 tier system: common, uncommon, rare, epic and golden epic. The loot is progressive so uncommon is a better version of common, rare is a better version of uncommon, and so on. There is no choice of equipment - they simply keep the highest tier available and disenchant the rest.Common, uncommon and rare drop from silver chests, the game's currency which each contain 3 items. VERY rarely a silver chest will be upgraded for free (about one in a hundred?) from a silver chest to a 'Jewelled' chest.These jewelled chests contain 5 items one of which will be rare or above. EPIC gear can only be had from these chests. These chests are sold 3 for $4.99. Buying chests is the difference between 'I might get the achievements this week' and 'See you in 2025'. Chest purchases also grant you a 24 hour 100% damage increase. Cheap, eh?What's worse is the Golden Epics. They come with 'flash sales' which appear periodically to try and pressure you into buying them within a 8-10 hour window. They are ridiculously powerful. Many grant 150% bonuses when common items might be 5%. There are ALOT of these golden epics. You'd have to spend hundreds of dollars just to get those that exist right now, and more to get those they add with each update. Power creep is inherent here - they bring out new characters and gear to outdate the stuff you paid for so you'll buy more stuff. It's a hamster wheel of pay to win crap.What's worse is the dev's have had bugs with the Golden Epic system awarding the wrong things - and refusing to correct all of it even though it's their fault. Even if you give them REAL MONEY for a in-game digital benefit which costs them nothing, they'll still give you the short end of the stick if their crap system glitches.This is nothing but a mobile phone quality java game that rewards continuous spending and excessive playtime over any semblence of logic, skill, or ability. This isn't a game, it's a money pit.",0

2254,"POE is like no other dungeon crawler I've ever played. The passive tree and skill gems are such unique character building mechanics that they became my favorite part of the game. The currency system has been excellently designed too; each unit of value is not only  valuable because it is money but because currency itself is expendable for varying magical effects on your items, transportation etc. The graphics are beautiful and controls are easy to pick up/remappable.  Some monsters, especially dungeon bosses can be very challenging (not to mention on higher difficulties - Cruel, Merciless) and take multiple tries to beat. The game lets you spawn back into the dungeon with damage you've already dealt persisting on the bosses so eventually you can brute force it if that's what you want to do, unless you are on Hardcore, in which case - Permadeath. Home building is mainly a neat distraction and hub for the Masters you can use to more easily craft powerful gear. My only complaint is that progressing through the whole life of a character to the end game requires that you do the same quest/storyline several times in a sort of new game plus style. The storyline is not bad by any means, in fact the world lore and theme is pretty cool but it can start to get repetitive. One of the best things about it, I've never spent a single dime and I get the same gameplay that anyone else who spends money on it does, because the majority of purchases available, other than more stash room (not necessary they give you plenty) are cosmetic only.Highly highly recommend to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers, and to anyone who hasn't tried one before, why not give it a shot? Free-2-Play after all.",1
9163,"Great game that a player can get a lot of 'free' fun fragging out of.To a new player this game can be a bit daunting and farming certs (at first) comes slow and turns many away.To gain certs faster (at first) you need to be an engi/med, stack your ability to gain more certs by spending certs in things that help others, forget weapons at first, if you work on your repair tool, ammo giving, health/shield giving, remote repping/ammo in a sundi while acting as a passive mobile medic for people close to your vehicle etc. Maybe spend a few certs on a scope if you find time to use it.Join a platoon/squad and actually fight with them as support and your +% bonus to certs increases giving you more certs. Joining a platoon/squad is also a great way to find big battles. Some outfits can be a bit authoritarian e.g. if you do not come and fight in the spot they are fighting in then they will kick you. Personally I think that is a bit lame, however you want certs and being in a constant battle is the best way to earn them.It is a hard slog at first and I made it harder by buying a gun for 1k certs when I could have increased my passive cert making skills as above, now however I make so much passive certs using engi/med with little work that I have 1k certs to spend on guns etc every couple of days.I have never spent a penny on this game, some customisations are given to the non spenders like me, such as the big christmas bow and the salty paintjob etc.There is a lot more to say about this game, such as the huge maps and battles that push front lines back and forth for hours whilst trying to outflank the opposing force. It is f2p, give it a go.",1
9760,"It's fun if all you're looking for is simple, fun combat. Eventually it does turn into grinding to get anywhere, but I just like to see if I can beat by best times on dungeon runs, and you can always fight bosses you're not supposed to yet if you're good enough at not getting hit.",1

The devs of this game is trying so hard to force you to buy your way to power instead of actually playing the game. 0/10 untill the devs start making a real game.Decided to give the game another go to see if it got better.

This game gets worse every damn time you play it. the game is full of bugs such a bolt action rifles looking like the they shoot twice so the shot you intended to hit some goes into the next postal code. complete broken spawn system, its also super easy for one person in a heavy tank to spawn camp your entire team. Most battles end in either total stalemates or a massive blitz that smashes one team. At this point it seems like the only thing that actually works in this game is the insanely overpriced store where you can buy yourself all the power in the world (only if you are dumb enough to even give these devs a penny for this joke of a game). I have a really hard time understanding why anyone would ever support the devs or this game what so ever when all they care about it taking your money and clearly not using it to improve the game at all. 4 years of being in ""beta"" should give you a pretty good idea of how little the devs care about their playerbase.

So you can do more grinding. Now.Thats not even that bad. But. Your not only grinding for the grind so you can do more grinding. Your grinding the grind so you can do more grinding for RNG. What your grinding for is never actually guranteed. I also feel terribly sorry for any parents that paid $10 for a SINGULAR GOLDEN KEY for their Child. So they can praise RNJesus 1 time.

You have to grind to get rng'd on these gems.Not only is everything about your characters determined by their gems and stats. You have to grind MORE to level those gems up.

11474,"Early Access Review Well, after some time playing this game I can say that I enjoyed it most of the time. Don't expect sometnig new from it, we've seen everything it has to offer 100 times before. TDM maps are mostly small, and designed for fast and agressive CQB, even if all of them have some kind of a sniper-designated area. Demolition/Assasination/Battle modes maps are a little bigger and will give you some breathing space. Not too much though. The real problem of the game, is the lack of a new content. I mean it's in development, so it has to get new stuff regulary, right? I was playing it for a year or so, and all new stuff i've seen was 1(one) new map and a sh**load of skins for guns/grenades/melee weapons. I'm an occasional player, meaning i can play 1 or 2 matches a day, sometimes not playing for couple of days at all, so i'm not too bored yet. But if you going to play it more often keep that in mind. Still, the game is well balanced and polished, it's fun to play. I'm an aggressive Submachinegun-runner type of a guy, so it'suits me well. Also a good thing is they don't lie about pay-to-win, real money won't give you any kind of advantage, ALL of the guns available for Bullets(real time money) can be bought for ingame currency that is earned really fast. So, in my opinion it's worth a try, it's free after all.",1

4338,"I have over a thousand hours logged on the android version, and have sunk a couple of hundred bucks into the game; so let me be frank.This is one of the only thing Konami has done in the past 5 years that wasn't an utter disaster. Duel links is a truly good iteration of the original Yu-gi-oh series; The format has been compressed and stream lined, such as a 30 card deck limi, three spaces for monster and trap cards, the removal of phases; but it works, and it works really well.  Most of your favorite cards are there, with more being added monthly to bi-monthly, and you can use all of your old strategies to really unleash a serious beat down on your opponents. Even though it's Konami, the game isn't money hungry either. Gems are used to buy card packs, but they come in an ABUNDANCE. Free events, all the time; give aways that require you to do nothing, log in bonuses, rank up bonuses. You don't have to spend a cent to get ahead.Likely though, you will. I don't know what sort of devil magic Konami used to polish this as much as it is, but it worked. I wanted to drop money to support the game, to open new card packs and get excited when I pulled Ultra and super rares. I wanted to drop ""Just five more dollars"" on the promotinal 5 for 10 + SR Packs.The last thing I want to talk about is Ranked- It works really, really well. You will find matches near instantly, with little down time. Unless the opponent tries to stall, turns move quickly, too- and with the inclusion of the stall busting timer, they can't indefinately lock you in until you quit, otherwise they'll take an automatic loss. It's never a problem for players who take a little extra time to think of a strategy though, so worry not. All in all, this might be a better title than some of the console iterations- They've recently added a GX section- though it's completely seperate from the original world, which means going forward, even if they add new series to the game, it isn't going to impact the series you enjoy playing. You won't have to contest with Synchro monsters when they're introduced using your OG yugioh cards. In this sense, it makes every battle feel equal, you dont feel like your cards are going to become obsolete.   It's a must try if you're a Yu-gi-oh fan. Even if you're not, but you have a casual interest in the card game via nostalgia or curiosity, it's worth your time to check out, most definately.",1
2641,"The amount of grinding that you need to do to unlock planes/tanks exponentially increases the more you play, to the point where it's impossible to unlock new vehicles without either pouring a huge amount of time or (as the devs clearly intend) money into the game. While fun to begin with, this grind really takes the enjoyment out of the game, so much so that I would strongly advise anyone reading this review to simply not bother and find a different game.The flight models are highly inaccurate, the matchmaking and tier system are appalling, and the devs appear to be highly incompetent and childish (to the point where they quit interacting with a popular website due to ""the users being mean in pointing out too many mistakes"").I would not advise playing this unbalanced grind-fest. Hopefully a competent dev team creates a competing game in the future.",0

2545,"This game starts out fun but as you get into the high ranks, it starts taking 50 to 75 games to unlock a single tank or plane. Very often two or even three of these tanks or planes are indentical in every way, save the name, meaning you spent 200+/- games trying to advance past them to something new. At the same time you start seeing players who paid real money for tanks that are practically invincible. Suprise, they kill you at will. On top of all this, there is a terrbile bias towards the Russian faction and games are generally one by whichever team has more russian players.",0

3105,"TL;DR - If you enjoy giving up your whole life to play a video game, that is unbalanced as all heck...then sure play it.....prepare to whip out your wallet and just give it to them otherwise.Well i put in enough time on this game to grace it with a review. First i would like to point out that despite it coming out a couple years after World of tanks/planes/ships....it still seemes to mess up the one thing that MOBA's(yes it's a MOBA, last time i checked u couldn't fly/drive from russian to paris or w/e) tend to be good at, and that's team balance in terms of game play. I mean you either ""know"" what to do, or you don't....simple as that, no team covering for you when you want to assault a point, no team providing fire support for you when you defend...it's basically a bunch of people running around shooting at things/people. I say things because there is PVE, although i would wager that some of the AI in this game is cheating...they know exactly where you are at all times, know exactly where to shoot at all times, never miss due to RNG, and will always score kills on you when they hit. It's a shame that such thought went into the RPG aspect of this game (at least more so than World of X) As you can already tell i have played both Gaigin and WG games, i like tanks, like ships more (although Steel Ocean is better at it than these two cash grab companies). All that aside, don't kid yourself this game is just a big ""long Con"" cash grab, the company i would imagine saw just how great and excited (aka dumb and gullible) us gamers were to see that we can progress the ranks and fight with better tanks if we just spent a little (a metric ton to be more clear) gold in the game (gold eagles being the Cash only currency).Don't get me wrong, i know there isn't any such thing as ""free to progress"" free to play meh ok, but most people get bored of playing a couple hours a day just to see you progress down your rank/tier couple 100 xp per battle for a win ( and you will lose often) when you need something like 50K xp to unlock a semi-decent vehicle. It's sad that they show pictures of naval combat on their store page, when they haven't even came close to being done with it....just a another sad marketing ploy by a sad and full of crap Company.

6818,"Many a money and many hours I've spent in this game for over 2 years. I use to play it for hours everyday and enjoyed it. I could write a whole essay on this game, but it doesn't deserve that. There are many a criticism I can make towards the developers, but I've been doing that for 2 years to no avail.Let's just say, that this a a FIRST PERSON SHOOTER, and it has LMGs. It got RELEASED before bipods, and bipods are still are not implemented. This is the kind of developers this game has. The kind of developers that LITERALLY reply to critisism with ""The silent majority disagrees!"" and ""Working as intended"" and NOTHING ELSE.This game will die when better WW2 FPS games come out later this year, and good riddance.",0

I like to play the RTS part off the game but its so unbalanced. Seems like RETO only support the bad guys with good weapons. They do not want to publish the bans so we dont know that something is happening when you take the time to report some asshols. On the forum you can say what you want but RETO will never or rarely listen to the players.Therefore, this bad review",0
2175,"If you like gear based grinding games then this one is for you.  Let me start out by saying that I enjoy a hard challenge and have to play on hardcore, where you only die once and then you drop down to standard mode (softcore).  Any character that drops down like this is dead to me, never to be played again.   I wasn't sold on this game at first as I got sick of dying at lot :) .  Lately been playing it a lot and more and now I understand the boss mechanics accept that I will die at some point but it's just a matter of how long I can last.With a massive skill tree where you can spend 120 skill points from 1350 skill nodes there is a large amount of replayability.  Even though there is a lot of repetition in replaying the same maps over and over (until you beat Merciless difficulty and move into endgame randomised ""maps"") it's the character customisation that keeps me coming back.  Give it a shot, I think it's worth it. ",1

Judging from how the devs have handled things so far, I doubt that. One last thing to note is that the characters will have a rotation model a la DOTA, so you will have to unlock the characters you want.",1

3058,"The greed of these devs has always been impressive. They do everything they can to push you to buying premium time and gold. At tier 4 and beyond the grind ramps up to a ridiculous level, but with premium you get double exp. Also silver is damn slow to get, but of course premium time gives you double silver too.And worse than just researching new vehicles, when you buy a new tank or ship you have to research fire extinquishers and repair kits for them, and the speed at which you do that also slows down at higher tiers. So once you get that shiny new vehicle all it takes is one touch to damage your weapon or engine or start a fire and there is nothing you can do about it unless you manage to reach your base or a cap point and live long enough to repair there, so most of the time the only option is to wait for death or suicide, because you will die anyway trying to reach a repair point.With ground forces specifically, there's the added grind to unlock new ammo types as well. Many tanks start out with an ammo type that is basically useless for what they will be going up against, and since you are unable to cause much damage it slows the grind down even more.But of course, if you buy gold you can instantly purchase these items and bypass the research time to skip the struggle!Got a new american tank destroyer and after about a dozen matches i still don't even have the repair kit because as soon as i see an enemy my inferior ammo bounces off them and when they return fire they can hit any part of my tank to put it out for the match instantly.Coming back to the game, I wanted to try out this new PvE tank mode, thinking it would be a good place to grind out repair kits and extinguishers for my tanks at least. The problem is that it's a wave assault purposely made to get your vehicles destroyed as many times as possible. And to respawn you need to pay silver... so it will just bleed you dry if you want to play it without premium.On top of this, the matchmaking and balance is total♥♥♥♥♥♥ A 1.0 rating difference between vehicles can be insane, and when you are bottom rating in a match it's a massive handicap. In air battle enemies will be faster, more durable, and can have 2-3 times the weaponry. In ground battles, anything focused on armor will be nearly invulnerable. In naval battles, you will get shredded by a single enemy shot.",0
6649,"Weapons are hilariously unbalenced, and it takes dozens of hours of grinding to get just the bare basics of the good weapons. Planes are OP as heck, and the graphics are all around bad.

The combat is utter garbage, the UI is unbearable, the camera is bothersome. Unlike most of the complaints having to do with ""Lag"" or FPS issues, server crashes, etc. I experienced none of that. I was just genuinely bored out of my mind. Theres nothing redeeming about this game. I'd go as far to say it's worse than Revelation online when that launched.

3721,The arena shooter is one of my favorite genres. Always colorful with a wide selection of personality filled characters. This game is very fun but needs more attention from Valve.I just started playing this game again a couple weeks ago. And my experience has been amazing. I stopped playing when Overwatch came out but now I haven't played Overwatch in awhile.One thing I love about this games is the wide range of customization for weapons and cosmetics. I have spent almost 100 dollars (I think) on virtual hats and weapons. I need help.,1
6486,"Early Access ReviewIm a simple man, I love killing Nazis but this game makes me just want to kill myself.I do not recommend the grind is ridiculous and if you really want to get anywhere you need to spend real cash. You'd think that the ingame cash would be somewhat cheap naw the DEVS just tell you to burn your hard earned money for some gold that does jack squat($6.92 for 1400) which is nothing. Don't fall for this scheme they try to get a beloved genre with a incredible point in history and they ♥♥♥♥ them. They make the game incredibly grindy making people who just want a decent WW2 game that isnt out of date shell out cash just to progress. They are using shady tactics to milk money out of people beware.",0
3501,"Early Access ReviewAlthough the combat goes too quick (the damage is a bit overpowered like in the days of Arma... you die in an instant if you are caught unaware), I now play this game more than PubG.  Great environment, and lots of mobility (not a walking simulator at all).Only thing that I would change:  The end game could use a perk of some sort NOT to shoot survivors if there is enough room on the helicopter (maybe gain only very minimal experience for the round if you shoot other survivors, have a target show up on your character next game... like an orange inmate suit, or something).",1
3592,"Early Access ReviewOk, so, data collection aside, the game is pretty good. If something good is free then YOU are the product.Mobility is nice and diverse (glider, snowboard and climbing pack).Biggest problem (in my opinion) are the bots. The game auto-fills a server with bots. I would say there are around 15-20 players/game out of 50.That being said, it's probably going to get better as the player base increase, but I would rather wait 2-3 mins for a game queue rather than play with bots (most queues are around 15secs). AI is dumb as all hell and on top of that sometimes it glitches and they just stand there for target practice.It's obvious it is not finished and they still need to add a lot of stuff. There is only 1 map and pistols are, for the most part, useless. There are no upgrades for them. Shotguns are also kind of useless as most engagements happen over long distances.If you're scared about the game sniffing around your PC you can try to sandbox it, I guess, or in a virtual machine. I play it on an HD7700 as an emergency since my regular card blew out a few weeks ago and I get decent fps for such a large map.I've been playing it with some buddies and we had quite a bit of fun with some intense moments.Customization is pretty low at the moment with few clothing items available and NO snow camouflage or white items whatsoever, mostly dark color apparel making you stick out like a sore thumb on that white background.

6872,"Pay 2 Win, Game could be really good BUT.Battlefield is very sparse and without using a paid account everytime you get killed in Battle it will be a long walk back to the point, in this time enemy normally has an advantage and caps the point.I love WW2 games and am always fair to the P2W model as it can work but this is geared for Free players to completely Fail.If you like WW2 then go ahead and take a play its not all awful, but unfortunately you will grow tired of how Unbalanced the game is.Day of Infamy would be a better bet if you want some WW2 action In My Opinion anyways.",0

6386,"Early Access ReviewIt is a really good game, i have not discovered the full potential yet. LOOK AT THIS REVIEW AS A STARTER PLAYER'S LOOK AT THE GAMEPros: The game is awesome,tanks,infantry,plane and everything you can ever want!!! Cons: 1.Why am i getting matched with 7+levels when im level 0...          2.Did i just get 1 hitted by a sub-machine gun?          3.Pay2win/pay2progress mechanics make the game even worse.          4.Atleast the graphics are allright.BUT if you have a beast computer considering the minimals recommendations umm yeah they are completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and your game wont even TRY to run at 60 fps even if your computer is above recommended.          5.LAG,LAG AND MORE LAG! If you're not in the European union,or america,dont bother downloading this game. Wait untill it's full release where there are more than 1 server.My perspective of the game is basically this-You start off as level 0. It forces you to get in a match when you start your game for the first time. You end up in a lobby with usually level 5+ players and even sometimes 7+. You get wrecked around them,you attack them with a bike,they attack you with a god damn armed car. Thank god you can shoot them pretty easily. It forces you to buy a sub-machine gun after you complete your first match.There are bugs,glitches but not that many,most of the time they wont bother you. I gave this game a chance or two, and i am still giving it a chance to redeem itself from the ''PAY2WIN/PAY2PROGRESS''  thing. People just buy a soviet tank and LITERALLY OBLIRIATE EVERYONE in a matter of seconds. Also,good luck getting trough a level with 1million xp while you get literally 5 xp for killing someone.I would give this a nice 4/10 in the face because of the matchmaking system being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the entire ''Veteran to increase gains and xp'' thing to the even buying gold thing,to the deepest part of grinding to 1 level to another. These are pretty easy things to fix but the developers dont give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about their fans/players. I saw 1 guy at the forums asking people ''What should we add at the next update?''.Also,this bike thing, like what the actual ♥♥♥♥,ok i know the technology wasn't that great but bikes? Aren't they suppoesed to get to the smallest conflicts atleast by an armed car or just walk the way?JUST WAIT UNTILL THE FULL GAME, IF THEY LISTEN TO THE PLAYERS THIS GAME WILL BE FANTASTIC.EDIT: I just got in 3 more conflicts, when i joined our team had no tanks whatsoever and the other entire team was attacking us with armored vehicles and 2 tiger tanks+ heavy armour destroyer (tank). The game is not balanced and i just dont know if it can be fixable when it got to this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t point.",0

12137,"Early Access ReviewIt's a self published MMO during its first week on the market, it's going to be unstable but the rate that Neowiz is patching, opening new servers and tackling issues show they care and to me that means a lot. Honestly if you want just wait a few weeks to buy the game, it's easy to level and from what I hear from the other clients the game does not start until your max level anyway.I see a lot of negative reviews because of lack of end game when in the early access disclaimer they state the end game is on the way. Right now i'm optimistic the game has a fun combat system which is something that MMO's have been lacking for a while. I'm not sure what it is but something about the game reminds me older MMO's. Is it the best MMO out, No.... but it's a refreshing spin in the genre and I look forward to the end game PVP with this skill based combat system. Also I want to give mad props to the devs for a nice cash shop with no P2W elements.",1
17470,"I enjoy this game, but I do have an issue with it: it shares the same geography as the original EQ. I know, I know it is all Norrath. That is not a problem in a broad sense, but it is for me. I have spent so much time delving into the world of the first EQ that being in a place that is the same but different seems odd. I just turn off that part of my brain and enjoy the game. ",1

2319,"On my experience with this game - I tried the game around 2 years ago I think. At first, I found it very overwhelming to understand the mechanics of the game such as skill gems, support gems, equipment sockets and links for the gems, currency, what to do with the currency (crafting, trading etc.) as this was one of the first games that I have ever played that was like this And so I didn't really try to understand it and just played it and 'tried' to beat the game - It was fun ofcourse! UNTIL..... I progressed further through the game. The game content got more and more difficult and because with the lack of knowledge that I had on the game, I sucked lol..... and yep, I gave up after a few days of playing. Thennn, after a year or two, I started to give it another try and actually take my time to understand the mecahnics, and I started researching about things that I don't really understand. After with some knowledge about the game mechanics and such, I actually got better and I got really into the game. And since then, it has been my favourite game and it's been the game that I played the most hehe...But yeah, overall - In the begining it was overwhelming because of the amount of information and mechanics of the game... BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE GAME NOICE!!! A lot of things to do  in the game.. a lot.For the newbies out there, if you sucked like me - researching character/class builds really helped me alot, and also trying to understand the game content really helps too. (It may take time tho - only if you suck)",1
1090,"Early Access ReviewThe makers did a very solid job importing a successful template into a 3D/space battle evironment.  Finding a good server to enter before it fills up is the trickiest part right now.  I'm also getting the impression that in some situations (when a game just ends), you can get stuck in the connection screen, thought I haven't really verified.  Once you're in the game, the performance is solid.  I haven't really encountered the memory bleed issue that other people have talked about.  Even at this stage I can see a ton of potential down the road.It is in prelaunch, so realize that:1. There's not as much content as a finished game, so battles do get old when you play several games in a row.2. You will be asking a lot of ""what does this ability do,"" again, this game is in pre-launch.3. You will ask questions in chat, and most people have been helpful; the environment is not (at least not yet) as toxic as some other similar games.",1

5620,"As someone who has put hundreds of hours into regular World of Tanks, this game fell astonishingly short. It takes the game of World of Tanks, and makes the teams about half as big. But what really sucks is it takes WOT and makes it way more cartoony, and childlike, and removes the artillery tanks. That, on top of the smaller teams, makes this a super fast-paced version, and takes out a lot of the strategy, replacing it with ""skill"" If you liked the game of World of Tanks, but it was too slow-paced for you, or you hated artillery, this is for you. Otherwise, if you are/were an avid WoT fan, this game will probably disappoint.",0

Old patches seemed to move the game forward by removing some bugs. Now  the Timoskenko update is out and has tons of issues. From balance to poor optimization of the general game. Poor servers with a ton of down time in the past two weeks. I dont consider this game pay to win but it would seem the developers dont care much about making general improvments. They would rather make ""more"" content to get more money from the people who actually buy stuff with money. I really hope they get there act together because this used to be a fun game. Honestly they really should be focused on making a enjoyable experience for the player then creating buggy and unbalanced mess of a patch that is Timoskenko.",0

I couldn't get my wheel  which admittedly is pretty ancient) to work properly, found the cars seemed to have no weight. Looks pretty enough but if actual gameplay sucks then its not worth the price of admission. In my humble opinion this doesn't hold a candle to the brilliant but old Papyrus Grand Prix Legends, which is still a challenging and enjoyable experience even ten years on. I can't recommend this game really but if you can get abetter controller it may be worth the time giving it a try but the free content is pretty limited and should really be described as a Demo not Free To Play. Disappointed as so many race games seem to be aimed at the console market, Codemasters used to produce some fun driving games but now fill their arcade racers with fantasy city tracks and boring drift courses, Isn't that what NFS was for? Perhaps I'll have better luck with AC. Meanwhile back to Grand Prix Legends ha ha. I also found the menu system here really clunky and poorly thought out, I quickly got bored with the free content and wasn't charmed enough to risk good money on this yet .

10563,"Early Access ReviewIn my brief (comparatively) experience with this game I have thuroughly enjoyed it. This has been stated many times but Eternal gives many advantages to F2p's that most CCGs do not. the game positively showers the player with gold constantly, giving out card packs filled with goodies at the slightest reason. You just won your first game of the day? Here's a pack! You just won three games in a row? Here's another pack! you get the point. Now, that being said the game does have flaws. I.E the power system, if you've played magic you understand the inherrent flaws that come with this system. Overall I don't have enough beef with anything here to justify a negative review, the deckbuilding is creative, though the power system is a tad restrictive for my tastes. and there are enough people playing that it usually doesn't take that long to find a match.8/10, you should at least give it a try!",1

3646,"Team Fortress 2 is a first-person shooter game from Valve.The gameplay is somewhat similar to Counter-Strike but with more variety of game modes, class based player, and unlike Counter-Strike, in terms of gameplay this game is more casual rather than competitive, at least for me. Everyone can play it, from kids, teens to parents, everyone can play. The game is very well balanced, each class has more than one unique abilities you can explore. You can get item drops as you play, and the more play, the more you can get. Items can be crafted for another better items too, or trade them for other items. And the best thing about his game is hats! Yes, hats. Most every damn people here on Steam loves them. You can show off your hats, craft it or even sell them! Many people make profit from it, many people collect it.Team Fortress 2 graphics is 3D but with cartoon style. Even though the graphics is cartoon, Team Fortress 2 still feature blood and gore effects.

You will just be thrown into a game where you most likely will not be equipt.3. Based on how well you did compared to other players in the match you will be given a crate with Random parts.4. The reward crates after a match contain 90% of the 20 worst parts out of around 200.5. Selling parts gives you very little funds to buy parts.6. No useful tutorials ingame. 7. Platoons can only contain 4 members(3 without premium)8. Lack of weapon types.9. Lack of weapon balance.10. Somthings I forgot to mention.Reasons to play this game.1. You like to spend money 2 win.2. You like creating robots.3. You enjoy arena based combat.4. You like paying for premium the entire play time.Notes for the devs.1. The Epic loot update broke the game.2. There is now no balance in the game after EPIC loot update.3. Your buisness practices have become bad for players.4.

Classes are hollow, abilitys are spammy, and literally everyone looks the same. They've lost systems that have proven to work in every game they've made, and forgot EVERYTHING when making this. Not to mention, WHAT Storyline?? On top of that releasing content thats farmfest, and takes maybe 1-3 hours to farm. I know some of you are saying ""Oh alpha"" ""Oh Early Access"". Let me put this in perspective, I beta tested the first areas nearly 3-4 years ago. They not only kept making areas the EXACT same way, but they didnt add story, they didnt add depth, and the content is hollow. Meanwhile AQ: For the love and everything holy, FOLLOW YOUR OWN GAME.

Here is how the game goes.1. get resources stabilized2. deal with random emergency (fire, roach infestation, mole-thing infestation, raiders)3. use most of your resources to heal your people4. run a mission5. slowly growth your shelter6. goto 1.It wouldn't be so bad, but #2 in the list is so obviously deliberate attempt to stifle growth/attempt to have you buy a microtransaction.  It also wouldn't be bad if there was some type of AI that would deal with the current random emergeny.  For example if you have a fire in a room with no one in it, you have to manually drag a person to that room to fight the fire.  When he is done putting out the fire he will just stand there, even if the fire moved right next door, until you either move him again or all fires are put out.Moving the people with a mouse is also very touchy/clunky at times.In the time it took me to write this review, I had 2 'random' incidents occur; a massive fire and a massive mole-rat outbreak.

11165,"Early Access Reviewoh hey look another ""competative"" card game. lets check it out.-Card pool not too big yet, easy to understand.-very similar to magic:the gathering. If you play on mobile, this is the best you can get. pretty cool that you can play on multiple platforms.-Gameplay is snappy and works well, havnt run into any bugs yet and i have played most of my time on mobile.              Now onto the bad stuff-The game literally FORCES you into what you put in your deck. If you are familiar with Magic:the gathering....you have land cards. This game is basically the same. The deck size is 75....you are REQUIRED(yes you literally have to put this much land into your deck in order to play it) REQUIRED to put 25 out of your 75 cards as land cards into your deck. Now, as a gameplay mechanic this is fine....HOWEVER! When you get mana screwed(when you only draw mana) or vice versa(when you only draw spells/creatures) it feels like the game's fault and not your own. In magic the gathering if you draw wrong it feels like it is your own fault; rebuild your deck with less mana/more mana. Even out that draw factor. This game takes the option out to make the deck the way you want to and forces you into the choice of getting screwed in mana. Players will say there is a way to build your deck to even out your mana curve. This is not untrue, however being forced to build your deck with certain cards in order to make your deck more consistant takes our player choice and basically forces me into taking basic cards into my deck that dont belong there just to make the deck behave somewhat consitantly. Regardless the deck size is so large that no matter what you build the deck will play 1 out of 3 different ways. Anyway......   - Basically here is how each game goes....         1.You draw your cards. Do you like what you see? if not then redraw and go to step 2.....           2. Alrighty so you have your 2nd set of cards...do you like what you see? No???? ♥♥♥♥ YOU go to step 3.             3. Play your land cards and stuff...keep going...Uh Oh...The other player isnt really playing anything....or did he just surrender!?!?!? Looks like they failed both steps 1 and 2...keep playing your cards untill they lose/surrender. YOU WIN GOOD JOB go to step 4                 4. New game, repeat steps 1 and/or 2. If you fail either one of these steps, surrender the game and repeat. If both you AND your opponent draw a decent starting hand....go to step 5....                    5. Actually havea decent balanced ♥♥♥♥ing game.Long story short this game is broken, any form of balance this game has is ♥♥♥♥ing ruined by RNG and broken mechanics that have nothing to do with the cards individually. The only way to balance this game is to change fundamantal mechanics and that is sad because this game has potential. I will still play this game on the phone....hard to justify wasting time with this game on the PC. Play this game if you are a fan of card games, the free to play system is very generous and whatnot, just odnt spend money on this game, esspecially with much better card games on the horizon. This game makes me sad. Sorry for the long review, i just am really into card games and this one proved to be a dissapointment dispite all of the solid ideas and mechanics that are represented in this game.",0
17277,"The best thing about this game is that it uninstalled really quickly. I spent 24 minutes with it, 20 of which were at loading screens. There are obvious animation issues, obvious load time issues, and the voice actors definitely phoned in their performances. The worst thing about this is, as a developer, I know that the developers knew this was bad. It was probably a mismanaged project with unreasonable deadlines and an underfunded budget.",0

You will get absolutely RAVAGED BY people that put money into the TANKS THAT CAN ONLY BE PAID FOR (most notably the Sherman Calliope and Panzerwerfer).Also, there is an extreme bias towards German and Soviet tanks. In the lower teirs, British and American tanks are simply no competition for Soviet T-34s and KV-1s and the Wehrmacht Panzers and Marders. To be fair, it is historically accurate, but in bad taste for a game that should be roughly equal opprotunity to all factions.",0

4058,"Roman Catholic sign of the cross is upside down, done with five fingers instead of three, is done from left to right instead of right to left, etc. (basically inviting demons). Antichrist's Third Temple will have 8 chambers: a chamber per main religion; antichrist will be crowned in this temple; during crowning, he won't read the ""belief prayer"" correctly (rejecting Christ and acknowledging himself); when he will take his gloves off to make sign of the cross incorrectly (just for show), many people will see his big nails and will reject him; Patriarch (who will be crowning him) will say that this is the antichrist; antichrist will kill him. Also, antichrist will kill those priests who disagree with him at the 8th ""wolf"" Council; others will worship him when a bird dies at his feet. Roman Catholics, Satanists, and Buddhists use the same mudras; if you see these mudras on an icon, then it's not Orthodox icon; Orthodox icon has IC XC symbol (Jesus Christ). Roman Catholics pay drunks and strippers to pose for icons; passions of drunks and strippers transfer to those who pray to these images. Normal Orthodox icons are inspired by the Holy Spirit. Gaad in Ruski = Satan; hence, Americans = blasphemers because they always say: ""Oh, my god!"". Santa (word for Saint in Satanic languages) = Satan; hence, Spanish + Italian + Portuguese = blasphemers. Anathema to Satanic languages; triple anathema. Learn Church Slavonic; no curses in it; curses = prayer to Satan. All religions except Orthodoxy worship Satan. On bread for communion: IC XC NIKA (Jesus Christ Conquers) plus cross = Orthodox; hexagram plus Dusha Maya = antichrist. Jews and Muslims pray head down (either standing, bowing, or kneeling); this is Satanic prayer. Orthodox look into the eyes of icon; energy goes their way; they get healed; head and shoulders come together to reject Satan slowly and then fast to normal showing allegiance to Christ and not the devil. Hands cannot be on groin or behind back; either put them crossing each other on chest (right over left) or just by your sides. Legs together so that a demon doesn't run underneath your legs. Clergy who will not ""put Buddhist icons and serve antichrist's blood"" will be killed; only 7 churches will be left as Pelageya of Ryazan predicted. In 2006 and at other meetings, fake patriarchs and bishops signed a bunch of documents betraying Orthodoxy by saying that all religions worship the same Supreme Being; triple anathema; don't let heretics tell you what to do. America will be last country to switch to Euro. Three big earthquakes will shake the three superpowers; 1st big earthquake in Russia; 2nd (bigger one) in China; 3rd (biggest of the three) will be in America. NATO will nuke Ukraine to blame Russia for it; then NATO will nuke Russia from Scandinavia. China will attack Russia; but will not get past Ural Mountains; bio-genetic weapon will be used against Chinese soldiers (they will run back to China and hide in closets in fear) and weather weapon will freeze Siberia to - 200 Celcius; stadium-size chunks of unmeltable ice will fall from the lower sky (because when rockets go into higher sky they bring this ice down to lower sky). Russia will destroy Turkey and America. China will have a hole across the whole country to the abyss (because of another super weapon used to stop Chinese aggression); radiation from this hole will be massive; Chinese will try to keep quiet about it; a lot of people will fall into this hole. Scientists don't see dinosaurs because of radiation. Only Eurasia and Alaska (both without coasts) will remain after demons blow up Antarctica (which surrounds the flat earth) and Greenland melts. Move to Ural Mountains or inland Alaska. Sionists wanted war between Russia and Germany from June 11th to October 11th on their holidays because (666 times 3)+(6 times 3) = 2016 (in their twisted logic). Tube people = demons. Clones = demons. Human costumes that demons wear = demons. Dinosaurs and 666ed people have triple stranded DNA; normal person can't swallow 666ed food (designed for 666ed people). Demons live inside clones. Bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin (who discovered Bubonic plague) is depicted on the Shroud of Turin. There is another shroud (Shroud of Milan) on which blasphemer Yosef (who was crucified on a pole in 1066 AD) is depicted. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Lenin (el=deity in Hebrew, nine = no in German; so, when chanted repeatedly is blasphemy against the Creator), and Yosef were possessed by Azazel; now, Rico Cortes is possessed by Azazel. WW3 happens; 7% of people will be left; after people are tired of war, they will elect the antichrist as one world leader; don't vote. ISIS stands for Israeli Secret Intelligence Service. Next false flag: Statue of Liberty in order to attack Iran; one big shake, one giant step forward, one giant collapse. Move away from coasts as nukes will go off in the ocean (at where tectonic plates meet; result: megatsunamis 1km high). Wear natural clothing so that if a bomb goes off it won't stick to the body as fast as synthetic clothes. All metal will be burned for fuel; so, save knives, crowbars, shovels, wood-burning stoves, etc. Also, save cloth/fabric/textile to cover the wounds and diseases. Eat natural food because nanochips, cells of aborted fetuses, bug DNA, and other poisons are in food that is commonly sold; reject vaccines, medical care, medicine, etc. because nanochips are administered thru IVs, implants, fillings, etc. If 1000-1500 nanochips are in your right hand, then you can't make proper Orthodox sign of the cross with the right hand; last mercy for you then will be to cut the hand off. Seraphim of Sarov and Sergiy of Radonezh will be resurrected after WW3 for a short time; Seraphim of Sarov will show the new Ruski Tsar who will fight the antichrist for about 2 years and 8 months. Those who go see Seraphim of Sarov will be healed of their infirmities/illnesses/sicknesses/ diseases; if you want to see him then, hurry because he won't stay longer than a few weeks. Earth is flat; stands on 3 pillars (the Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreams are from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Humans were created about 7525 years ago. Ruski Orthodox Christian Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Enoch and Elijah return to preach against the antichrist. Birds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level. They will get out through sinkholes and lakes. To kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite people to be healed inside their UFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. Don't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)Moon 2)Inside fake mountain Kailash in Tibet 3)In lake Baikal in Russia 4)In Atlantis which is underneath the Mariana Trench in Pacific Ocean. There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old. He flies very fast; deceived people will say that ""Christ is here; Christ is there"". Sometimes, he wears blue robe over left shoulder while red robe is underneath. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He's surrounded by demons who appear as angels of light.",1

Love how the combat is setup in this game, PvE dungeons are not to easy, deff not like wow or other MMOs where you can go in a dungeon pretty much braindead, here in Bless takes alot of work learning your class, gear, combos, before you are able to clear a dg sussessfully.

The graphics looks nice and I the idea of a group vs group and a 100 vs 100 mode seemed super fun. So, I downloaded the game and started customizing my character and was having a lot of fun because the customization menu was v detailed. After making my character, I continued to the main ""basics training"" part of the game and I just found the instructions so frusterating and difficult. The main movement controls are fine and easy, but the controls to fight and use power ups were just too annoying for me to try and figure out. I think it would have been better if you could just use the right and left click of your mouse, and maybe scroll through the different power ups to use in battle. I was really rooting for this game to work for me but it just doesn't. If anyone reading this review has tips to make the gameplay more easy and fun please let me know.",0

6194,"Early Access ReviewPay 2 Win. I have been playing this game for a long time, before GreenLight was introduced, before anyone might even think it will be on Steam. Since all that time, I lost the count of years that passed. The game remained in nearly the same stage it used to be. Graphics are as bad as they were, and so are the sounds, and the rest as well. Free players can play, but will encounter so many obstacles, they are most likely to bounce off of them, and stop playing. Everything is so expensive, it takes ages to grind for, unless you pay with real cash. If you pay, you can have everything straight away + extra slot for weapon, and extra slot for a bage, otherwise... Want a weapon? No problem, grind till death. Want to upgrade your weapon? No problem, grind till death.  Want new character, or more slots for them? No problem, grind till death. Want a vehicle, or more slots for them? No problem, grind till death. One of the features in this game is possibility to have assault team, but you will rather die of the old age, than ever have one. As long as everyone remembers, Americans were always OP with the M1 Garands, now Germans have Gewehrs 43 to counter them, but still M1 Garand owns. Previously it was M1 Garand against Kar98k. Spawn♥♥♥♥♥♥is present, just as it was before. Take a tank and park it in front of the enemy base. 10/0, 20/0, 30/0, 40/0 etc., such stats of the tank crew are not rare to see. The team with the tank wins the game in 99.99%./Edit.Recent update introduced new nation, Russia. I cant tell anything about their tanks, but surely their aiplanes are the best at the moment with two bombs, beside the infantry having the best gun which is PPSz. Russians also have the best all rounded gun in the game, which is PTRD. It kills infantry with one shot, it destroyes light vehicles with one shot, and is capable of destroying pretty much all of the low tier armored vehicles in couple shots. It is also possible to shot down aircrafts with it. At the end, I need to add, that the Russian infantry have the best default camouflage, which makes them hard to see, everywhere./Edit. Heroes & Generals is run by communists. They spread propaganda, lies, delete posts, topics, ban people that have different opinion. They glorify the Communists, and Sickle with Hammer.From the forum topic.""The Hammer and Sickle is there to stay, where as we won't implement Axis symbols such as the swastika in the game.There are tons of countries and organizations all over the world that sadly committed atrocious crimes against humanity. The Axis's have a very large negative reputation in this aspect, represented by their flag, a 'face' and their concentration camps. In this game, the German faction is the Wehrmacht and not f.e. the SS.The hammer and sickle also represents some of the above mentioned, but the symbolic value is way less concise and known. It goes beyond war crimes and is more arbitrary.The topic will remain locked, as this is just an open flame war.~Circinus""I do not recommend.",0

Instead of giving me the same items over they could have given a backpack and/or holster for my purchase plus some starter in game premium coin. To add insult to injury, the game lacks any sort of serious gameplay. This game needs the patience of a saint, even worse, once you get into the game no only is your kills not worth anything unless its based on a mission but the ones you do get don't give much to begin with...

11610,"Early Access ReviewThis is the best F2P FPS game out right now, and possibly ever. It feels superior to Warface and Blacklight Retribution, and is clearly better than games like Alliance of Valient Arms or Crossfire. The graphics are very decent and run buttery smooth on nearly any machine. If you can run windows, you can run this game. Hands down the best feature in-game is the grind for weapons, by that i mean that currently, all guns can be grinded for by playing matches (granting Gold) and leveling up (granting metals and other cool rewards). There are currently no weapons that are overpowered and are behind a paywall. On the topic of overpowered, there are, as with all games, some balance issues. The Blazer (sniper) and KSG (shotgun) are clearly overpowered.  Some assault rifles are lackluster and SMGs are far weaker than Assault Rifles. Not to mention Grenade Launchers on certain maps sometimes give an unfair advantage and on others they are absolutely terrible. The developers have been consistent about listening to community feedback and it really seems like they want this game to grow, so please support if you can. TL;DR: Non-pay to win good feeling and looking Free FPS. Get it!  ",1

11208,"Early Access ReviewIf you're looking for a way to play Magic: the Gathering online besides the barely functional official client, this is your game.If not, I wouldn't recommend this game.This is the straightest ripoff of MtG I've ever seen.  Most puzzlingly, Eternal preserves what is usually acknowledged as one of Magic's biggest flaws: the resource system.  While every other Magic-esque game has sought to improve the system that Richard Garfield came up with in 1993 when no one had ever done this before, Eternal changes nothing.  Meaning you can look forward to games where you lose because you didn't draw enough resources, and also games where you lose because you drew too many resources and not enough business cards.  This was a source of RNG that even *Hearthstone* thought was too swingy and unfun.  If you like the idea of having a certain portion of your games decided because one player drew his cards in the wrong order and thus didn't get to play much at all, then go for it.But I kind of expect better foundation-level design from card games made in 2016.",0
1593,"Early Access Review:TL;DR - its a fun, well built moba, with room for more maps and ships to keep people interested. currently there is only the 1 map, but it is solid.

DONT DIE.-The map is crazy fun once you understand how it works and how to navagate it.-jumping = hidiously vulnarable, knowing when to jump is critical to winning. (more so when you play big slow ships like the colossus, destroyer, gladiator, or leviathan.)-Gamma Buff is a game ending mechanic to keep games short, Gamma 3+ allows the holders to jump streight to the enemy base, IN ADDITION to the normal buff goodness. If you ignored Gamma 1-2, you can NOT ignore Gamma 3 without serious consiquence.-Lots of incentives to login daily and play games - free stuff is rarely a bad thing.CONs: -what the hell are upgrades?! (ANS: it's your ship leveling up after your team gains resources for those bases you cap'd that send out mining tugs that you maybe have been destroying. upgrades are automatic once you go back to/capture a base that you could 'heal' from; you will notice your hp max has gone up. at lv3,6,9 you can pick a major upgrade to your ship (B) damage + RoF, (N) defence, hp, armor up, and (?) utility... #notasupport-looks like a rip off of Dreadnaught (which im really anxious to play..) but whatever, right?(ANS: now that Dreadnaught is mostly out, they are NOTHING alike. This is more like League of Legends.)-no real balance between the factions.. (ANS: but that doesnt matter because 'factions' dont actually matter in game, they are just 'flavor groups' each has their 'hard to play ships' and ones that you will fall in love with...)HOW TO PLAY...-Jumps: jumps have a fairly long delay (jump prep) before going off. 'jump home' is about 2-3sec longer than the normal 'jump' and has a MUCH longer cooldown. while in 'jump prep' you take a bazillion times more damage, so getting shot while jumping is bad and will ususally kill you.-Death Timers: dont get caught at one of the enemy forward bases when they are ready to respawn. watch the map; getting dunked by the nme team for trying to take the base isnt worth it.-Gamma: not 100% necessary before Gamma3, after that, the game is basically in a slower 'sudden death' as every ship WITH THE BUFF can jump to the nme base and has a CAP RATE BUFF.-Team Fighting: FOCUS THE DAMAGE or THE HEALER. if you are fighting for gamma things like the Raven, Enforcer, Ghost, Furion, Brawler, Interceptor, NEED TO DIE ASAP or you wont have a team left.-Positioning: USE TERRAIN. If you arent the tank, let the tank be first in, then, SUPPORT THE TANK by killing their damage first. Terrain will save you when you are low hp, have swarms of missiles incomming, or an angery Lev that wants to lazor you off the map. Mines are also good hidey spots for a quick jump home to rep.PRIORITIZE FLYING WHERE YOU NEED TO GO OVER SHOOTING PPL UNLESS YOU CAN WIN. flying into a rock because you were in a fight with an interceptor and are now loosing is a great way to get wrecked.USE YOUR FORWARD BASES. they heal you. fighting while being healed gives you a pretty big advantage. plus there is a giant los blocking shield you can pop up from behind! KNOW YOUR OPTIMAL RANGES - just because you CAN shoot, doesnt mean you should. ALWAYS consider your range with high damage shots like those from the Raven, Interceptor, Centurion, and Leviathan, you go from doing a few hundred damage to a few thousand.. kinda important.Rocket weapons (ghost, pioneer, overseer, watchman, guardian), and all smart guns, have no optimal range, only a max range.JUMP HOME. '6' sends you home. it takes longer to charge than a normal jump, but it doesnt need you to open a menu. additionally, if you jump home you STILL HAVE YOUR NORMAL JUMP to IMMEDIATLY go some place else.POSITIONING IS KEY.-Cloaking.. detection will only mess you up if you are cloaked when it goes off. being cloaked and moving will use energy. not moving while cloaked will let it recharge. entering enemy controlled capture zones (bases/mines) will decloak you. you need to be fully decloaked to contribute to capture and to heal at bases. YOU CAN JUMP CLOAKED.-The Enemy Base: it has 3 turret generators each side, just being in the capture area will let you contribute to capturing it - this will decloak you. once you are in the enemy base zone to can linger outside the capture area, this can be a HUGE headache for the nme. even after they have recaped their forward bases. killing off the base turret gen's means less passive damage for your team which is particularly nice for your healer who generally cant self-rep (Superlifter CAN self-heal and is OP because of this).CARRYING..Use your team. your AI is garbage in some ships. new players are garbage in most ships. this can be mitigated by pointing out the things that Must die, either by ping, chat, and or shooting at the target. Dont rage, play smart, support your team on pushes, dont try to solo cap the nme base when gamma is up. win gamma. win the game.Carry Ships: generally range is your friend. -Heavies suffer from a lack of mobility but can help anchor your team in fights for base or gamma. IMO the Ageis is pretty solid with its speed, hp, smart gun, and team wrecker, it suffers at close range and from the Basilisk.-Mediums are your bread and butter. do the damage, make the enemy team disappear so yours can win. you gotta know target priority, LoS, and how not to get focused. Interceptor and Furion are scary dps ships.-Lights and Supports have a couple issues, biggest: their lack of hp makes them unforgiving if you get focused. secondly, damage vs reps.. reps are limited, damage is significantly less so. A well played Superlifter or Protector can be VERY strong, but if your team starts to really fall appart you have very little to counter with. Raider and Raven are VERY powerful damage boats, and can 1v1 most things, this means you can hold a base while your team recovers; downside is both revolve around 1 ability which isnt always up.Now..3ker's Guild to Ships:...(see comments)",1

7308,"On one hand, the gameplay is really great. It feels halfway between Magic and Hearthstone, and the interactions between cards are really deep and interesting. You have to think quite hard about how to solve problems. The quests feel unique and are fun!On the other hand, it very much feels pay-or-grind-for-years-to-play. It's really frustrating to be continually paired against players with dozens of legendary cards at the lowest ranks, because those cards are SO powerful.If you're just starting out, it's probably not worth it, you'll be slaughtered by all the players with their existing collections, unless you're willing to spend $100+ on some core cards and expansions.

10810,"Early Access ReviewA better-than-paper CCG experience in an ideal digital UI.

Getting a lot of cards from just going vs the AI which is great to see. There is a second campaign that rewards a new set of cards but costs a loooot of in game currency or the equivalent of about 8 euros. The cards it rewards seem just as balanced as the standard set and are definitely not in the realm of ""oh well if I dont have those I'm ♥♥♥♥ed"".I spent just under a tenner in the in game store more out of a thank you for the amount of hours enjoyment I got from the game thus far.

14886,"Early Access ReviewThis game was great, once.Until the developers ruined it. This is my opinion for 3 reasons.1. The Tech TreeRobocraft used to be so much fun when the Tech Tree was there. It gave the game a purpose, something to aim for, to       unlock better gear. Since that us now gone the game has no purpose, it has become Minecraft 2 where you can just build whatever you like.2. The Tier SystemAll the original players would agree that Robocraft was better with the Tier System. It made the game fair for everyone and made it so you could get matched with Robots the appropriate level to yours. The Tier System and The Tech Tree were what made the game great as you had to play games, earn tech points, unlock new gear and keep doing this until you could get your Robot to the next Tier.3. GameplayIn the Respawn and Overclocked update the gameplay changed dramatically both negatively and positively. It made it some once you were dead you were still in the game but this damaged certain things. For me this update made the medic useless. Instead of the idea of the medic helping fallen team mates and stopping team mates getting eliminated they altered it so if you were damaged you could just respawn. I know they kept the normal gamemode but no one played it. Recently to help with the creation of this game becoming Minecraft 2 they have made it so your Robot no longer requires a pilot seat. This is stupid in so many ways and now the Rail Cannon has become somewhat useless. It used to be that if you headshotted a Robots pilot they were instantly destroyed and still is. This means that people who don't have pilot seats have a huge advantage. Overall Robocraft has been completely destroyed and made unenjoyable.P.S. I used to play the game through the launcher not through Steam so don't think I'm just some noob with 8.9 hours.",0

10155,"I am a long time player and will try to make this review informative and realistic.*** GameplayI tried this game and liked it so much that I purchased a one-year membership after a few days. The relaxed and realistic atmosphere is likely one of the biggest sellers for the game. You basically roam the woods looking for animals, or clues that can lead you to them. There are a lot more animals in the game than what you would see in real life. Also the animals are less shy than in nature, so that you will find plenty of them even in a short hunting session. You will discover traces on the ground or hear animals call somewhere in the distance. Once an animal is tracked down, you may opt for a kill or move on. Tracking gets easier the more you play. With the increasing number of tracks that you pick up, your skill level rises and tracking becomes easier. It also happens a lot that you see single animals or a group of them roaming around as you walk through the reserves. This game is not for someone trying to get satisfaction in a lot of animal shooting in a short time. *** MembershipsAll players start as ""guest"" and receives a free rifle and life-long free ammunition for this gun and some basic equipment. A membership is a time-limited license that will unlock all animals, free ammunition for all weapons, and also the ability to host multiplayer parties. A permanent license is not available.*** Hunting GroundsThe reserves in the western part of this world resemble of American continent-based areas, the eastern part holds areas that you could easily find in Europe. Currently seven reserves are available. Each has its own charm and of course its animal species. At the beginning of every hunt you select a reserve. You can start from a permanent lodge or from a tent that you have placed in the reserve before. The maps are very big and if needed there is a fast travelling system.*** AnimalsAt this point the game features 18 species. Some of them can attack the player. Many can be lured with callers, scents or decoys. Then there are baiting stations that will bring the animals to a certain location. Most bird species are only scored if shot in the air, which is always a fun challenge. For many species unusual fur variations can be found, some of which are truly rare. Shooting such a rare animal is just as special as a trophy buck. Shooting animals in theHunter quite demanding. The animals have bones and organs, and every shot should be thought through before the trigger is pulled. Hitting vital organs will lead to death, bad shots can result in a follow-up search.*** WeaponsA host of rifles is available, all of which can be equipped with scopes for longer shots. Using the open sights can be just as much fun though. Depending on the knock-down capabilities of these guns they are allowed to be used for larger or smaller game. There is also a selection of handguns, some with plenty of power to even kill a moose. Shotguns can be used with three types of ammunition, which makes them all-around weapons for all animals. Shooting guns makes all animals in the area flee. Bows can be used as silent killers and will not alarm other animals unless they are really close.*** EquipmentThere is equipment that can be permanently placed in the reserves. Tents let you to start a hunt where ever you placed them before, and they give you access to your entire inventory just like a lodge. There are treestands that can be mounted to trees for a better overview of the area. Ground and waterfowl blinds protect you on the ground from being seen, and a tripod stand provides some elevation for easier animal spotting. *** In-game MoneyAll game items are paid with the in-game currency em$. It can be purchased with real money, won in competitions, or earned by completing third-party offers. Also there are gm$ that can be earned by completing missions, allowing to buy consumables. Non-consumable items belong to the player permanently, even if a membership expires. *** MissionsCurrently there are a total of 245 missions available. Most mission packs start rather easy and become increasingly more difficult. You will end up shooting pheasants or geese in air with bows, or try to make a moose attack you for an adrenaline kill.*** Competitions & LeaderboardsCompetitions are run around the clock for all animals. Players from around the world sign up and compete against each other. The top players receive a trophy which appears on the player's profile. In addition em$ can be earned. All animals of all players are compared during every season and represented on leaderboards. The best players will make their way into the Hall of Fame. *** MultiplayerMultiplayer parties are client-based, there are no MP servers. In the game it is possible to chat with others. Players can hunt as team or on their own. It is advisable that people from the same geographical regions connect for such games, or there can be lagging.*** Things I don't like- The website's style is not ""outdoor-like"". Also the font size and the line spacing are too large. There is a lot of scrolling to be done when going through statistics or the store.- The large antlers of the Red Deer are completely unrealistic. The red deer in the game does not look like the real one, and that is a real pity for me, being European.- Some animals have too large eyes and thus look like large baby animals. The most obvious ones are the Brown Bear and the Roe Deer.- It is not possible to jump or climb over the smallest obstacles and you have to circumvent them.  Sometimes it would be handy to climb a rock and gain a bit better overview, but many rocks cannot be climbed.*** ConclusionThe game is constantly being enhanced with new content. It remains one of the best games I have ever played, and certainly played for the longest time. Playing long nights is not tiring even if it gets really busy around you at times. It is unique with its  lively environment and ambient sounds, but can be just as much challenging when trying to pin down the trophy animal. There is a great random factor and unpredictability, which I think among many other things is the greatest achievement of the developers. I keep playing because every game session can be so much different to the former, and so the game just never gets old. ",1
